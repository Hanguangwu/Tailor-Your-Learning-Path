</ul>","<p>How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?</p>
<p>Remote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.</p>
<p>Remote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.</p>
<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.</p>
<p>Remote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— <em>The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere</em>. Praise for the book includes:</p>
<p><em>""Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives. Few of us are going back to the way we worked. Read her book and begin to prepare for the other side of this pandemic now."" - Larry Culp, CEO of GE</em></p>
<p><em>""I often talk about the importance of trust when it comes to work: the trust of your employees, and building trust with your customers. This book provides a blueprint for how to build and maintain that trust and connection in a digital environment."" - Eric S. Yuan, Founder &amp; CEO, Zoom</em></p>",1.7,15

</ul>","<p>Modern systems today must be designed for agility in order to outpace the competition. Concepts like Agile, DevOps, and Data Science were once considered only for the technology-based companies. Today that means every company. Because there is no greater currency than timely information for optimizing operations and meeting the needs of customers.</p>
<p>Modern product management requires that every development and operations value stream is identified and continuously improved. This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.</p>
<p>Agile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point. The evolutionary nature of the product with so much change enables functionality, design, and technology to drive and influence each other simultaneously. And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.</p>
<p>Data science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls. This means all data is fair game, and when tagged and stored properly, can be made available at nearly any scale for preparation, visualization, analysis, and modeling.</p>
<p>We’ll teach you the paradigms, processes, and introduce some key technologies that make the data-driven product organization the optimal competitor in the market.</p>",2.3,17

<p>For each case, students visit the HMS Clinical Skills Center to observe the initial patient encounter and physical examination by an orthopedic surgeon. Following the patient encounter, students complete the interactive gross anatomy, histology and radiology learning sessions essential for understanding the case. The anatomy learning sessions include observing actual dissections in the Harvard Medical School anatomy laboratories revealing and explaining the human anatomy relevant for each clinical case.</p>
<p>After completing the case learning sessions, students review pertinent radiology images, commit to a tentative diagnosis from a list of differential diagnoses, and accompany the patient to a virtual operating room to observe the surgical treatment. In the virtual operating room, students observe narrated videos of actual surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Clinical content for each case is developed in close collaboration with leading orthopedic surgeons and radiologists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</p>

<p>""Databases"" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>
<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>
<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>
<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",2.5,15

</ul>","<p>This course is a variant of HarvardUniversity's introduction to computer science, CS50, designed especially for lawyers (and law students). Whereas CS50 itself takes a bottom-up approach, emphasizing mastery of low-level concepts and implementation details thereof, this course takes a top-down approach, emphasizing mastery of high-level concepts and design decisions related thereto. Ultimately, it equips students with a deeper understanding of the legal implications of technological decisions made by clients. </p>
<p>Through a mix of technical instruction and discussion of case studies, this course empowers students to be informed contributors to technology-driven conversations. In addition, it prepares students to formulate technology-informed legal arguments and opinions. Along the way, it equips students with hands-on experience with Python and SQL, languages via which they can mine data for answers themselves. </p>
<p>Topics include algorithms, cloud computing, databases, networking, privacy, programming, scalability, security, and more, with a particular emphasis on understanding how the work developers do and the technological solutions they employ may impact clients. Students emerge from this course with first-hand appreciation of how it all works and all the more confident in the factors that should guide their decision-making. </p>

</ul>","<p>How can we ensure that we don’t fail the next generation of children? What investments do we need to make an impact? What implementation decisions do we need to make for program success?</p>
<p>An estimated 250 million children in low- and middle-income countries risk not meeting their development potential in the first five years of life—leading to lifelong impacts on health, learning, behavior, and overall adult productivity. During this critical time, strategic interventions can ensure children have a strong foundation to lead healthy, productive lives as engaged citizens.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need to increase access to high-quality early childhood development intervention programs on national and global scales. While the science behind the importance of early development and funding for these programs has increased globally, policy development, research, and implementation best practices have not been widely adopted. As the COVID-19 virus disrupts health, nutrition, childcare, and education services, and stretches social and child protection systems to their limits, children and families least able to cope are being hit hardest with inequities in childhood development widening. Evidence-based policies that support families and young children are needed now more than ever. This course examines best practices in child and family policies, advocacy, financing, and pathways to scale—showing you how to generate an innovative, scalable intervention strategy that supports early childhood development. ****</p>
<p>The course begins with a review of basic early childhood development concepts and successful implementation programs around the world. We learn why some programs succeed where others do less well and what strategies are key for enabling widespread adaptation of quality programming. For those working around the world in early childhood development programs, this course allows you to reflect and evaluate your own organization by reviewing real-world case successes, as well as a new global perspective from other learners. You will complete the course with new plans and ideas ready to implement within your program.</p>

From casually discussing what to have for dinner tonight with your family to passionately debating the best candidate to vote for in the upcoming election, arguments are a method to better educate ourselves and understand others.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

All arguments share an underlying mapping structure that backs a main claim with supporting reasons, sometimes including counterpoints to anticipated objections. In order to present an argument that will clearly communicate your perspective, you must first understand the basic structure of any argument and develop your logic and critical thinking skills.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

In Structure and Function of Argument: Introduction to Critical Thinking, you will engage in dynamic practice exercises to develop the ability to recognize, analyze, and construct arguments you encounter on a daily basis. You will consider the structure of an argument, focusing on the underlying organization of claims and reasoning. You will determine if the reasons support the author or speaker’s main claim, build well-constructed responses, and grow your overall English language skills. You will also test your listening skills by recognizing how things like logical fallacies, conflicting points of view, and controversial subjects can impact effective communication.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Using a tool called “argument mapping,” you will visually diagram the structure of an argument to identify how reasons connect and function in an argument. You will then apply your learnings and test your own arguments using this tool – allowing you to gauge the overall quality of your arguments and take steps to make them stronger.</p>

<li>Understand how the skills of emotional and social intelligence support organizational happiness and productivity</li>
<li>Develop research-based strategies for strengthening empathy and resolving conflicts constructively</li>
<li>Learn how to lead with social intelligence</li>
</ul>","<p>One of the key insights from the science of happiness is that our own personal happiness depends heavily on our relationships with others. By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.</p>
<p>This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.</p>
<p>Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.</p>
<p>What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.</p>
<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide.

Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>
<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>
<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",2.9,8

<p>This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country’s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change. </p>
<p>We will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights.

If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? </p>
<p>Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. </p>
<p>This course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won’t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? </p>
<p>This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance. </p>

As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>The first part of this course is comprised of seven lessons that introduce causal diagrams and its applications to causal inference. The first lesson introduces causal DAGs, a type of causal diagrams, and the rules that govern them. The second, third, and fourth lessons use causal DAGs to represent common forms of bias. The fifth lesson uses causal DAGs to represent time-varying treatments and treatment-confounder feedback, as well as the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment. The sixth lesson introduces SWIGs, another type of causal diagrams. The seventh lesson guides learners in constructing causal diagrams.</p>

</ul>","<p>Chemistry is the study of the properties, structure, behavior, and reactivity of matter. As the central science, chemistry has connections to fields from physics to biology, from environmental science to nano-science. A fundamental understanding of chemistry is the basis on which cutting-edge research in many fields rests. This course is designed to build core skills in chemistry, including drawing chemical structures and predicting molecular properties and reactivities, as well as to gain the necessary fundamental knowledge for advanced courses such as Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry, or Materials Science. </p>
<p>This chemistry course is the first in a series of two courses that together cover first-year, University-level chemistry. In this course, you will uncover the principles of chemical bonding, in the way it historically occurred: starting from the first experiments that revealed the fundamental dual wave-particle nature of energy and matter. Using the machinery of quantum chemistry, you will learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>build models to describe the electronic structure of atoms,</li>
<li>examine how atoms can be combined into molecules through different chemical bonding models,</li>
<li>predict the structure and geometry of molecules,</li>
<li>analyze how molecular geometry determines molecular properties,</li>
<li>explore how molecules interact with each other and analyze how these interactions impact properties in a variety of phases</li>
</ul>
<p>This course is based on material in MIT’s Principles of Chemical Science course, which fulfills the General Institute Requirement in Chemistry for all MIT undergraduates. </p>

<li>Apply specific technical strategies to the investment selection process</li>
<li>Develop trading strategies based on technical theories</li>
<li>Evaluate indicators and patterns based on quantitative analysis</li>
</ul>","<p>In order to apply technical analysis with confidence, it is important to understand the theory of technical analysis, why it’s a rational approach to market analysis and how this discipline relates to fundamental analysis and investor psychology.</p>
<p>To build that confidence, we begin with an explanation of how technical analysts view the market in terms of supply and demand. We detail how the analyst develops information about the relative strength of the bulls and the bears through price charts and other tools.</p>
<p>Price charts are one of the primary tools of technicians. Charts provide a history of market action and analysts can observe patterns in the chart. As early as the 1930s, analysts determined that certain patterns tended to precede certain price moves. This course reviews those patterns, discusses how to identify the patterns and supplements this with concepts form behavioral finance to explain why the patterns are predictive. Different chart types are presented and important charting concepts are explained from a practical perspective.</p>
<p>In addition to charts, technical analysts also use indicators and various theories to forecast the direction of prices through the study of past market data.</p>
<p>We focus on defining and applying momentum indicators to make buy and sell decisions. Instead of simply explaining and illustrating popular indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD and stochastics, we review historical back tested results of each indicator so that you can objectively evaluate their performance.</p>
<p>Indicators based on the sentiment of various groups are analyzed and breadth indicators are explained.</p>
<p>In addition to indicators, theories applicable to trading are studied.</p>

In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.</p>
<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. You will need to know some basic stats for this course. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>

<p>In <em>Tangible Things</em> , you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. This course will draw on some of the most fascinating items housed at Harvard University, highlighting several to give you a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.</p>
<p>By “stepping onto” the storied campus, you and your fellow learners can explore Harvard’s astonishing array of tangible things—books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The University not only owns a Gutenberg bible, but it also houses in its collections Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century “spirit writing” chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau’s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but also for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History Museum not only preserves dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.</p>
<p>In the first section of the course, we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard’s history, and you will learn the value of stopping to look at the things around you.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.</p>
<p>Finally, we will consider methods of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.</p>
<p>Along the way, you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.</p>

Compilers,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/3a287fad-9544-46ea-bc6a-85863940a402-98b9d78d8cba.jpeg,https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/stanford-university-compilers,"<p>This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>","<p>Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed since the 1950’s. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.</p>","<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
<p>An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.</p>

Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.</p>
<p>The fundamental question that we will address in this course is ""when does one statement necessarily follow from another"" --- or in the terminology of the course, ""when is one statement a <em>logical consequence</em> of another"". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.</p>","<p>While logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts. The goal of the course is to show how natural English statements and arguments can be formalized and analyzed.</p>","<p>In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.</p>
<p>All learners receive a complete textbook and software package ($55.00 value).</p>
<p>We will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.</p>",2.6,13

Using research from neuroscience and psychology, we will look at the process of storing long-term memories, and how you can help your students do this effectively. </p>
<p>We will also examine the way the brain changes from birth to adulthood, and how these affect the way we learn and remember information. We will explore how teaching to a child’s developmental stage can benefit students and teachers. Then, we will dive into neurodiversity in the classroom, covering the current understanding of autism, dyslexia, ADHD and other cognitive differences, and how best to support these pupils. </p>
<p>Throughout the course, we will discuss how to apply this learning to your own classroom, and what the evidence says about the best ways to teach. By understanding more about the way memories are stored and recalled, we can explore different ways you can support your students to learn efficiently, so the memories last a lifetime, not just until the exam.</p>",4.0,9

<p>Lean decision making tools for agile project managers</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Agile can often challenge project managers in the realm of leadership. Old styles of command-control are now a thing of the past, except for the most conservative organizations. While good leaders employ a variety of leadership skills and leadership styles to motivate team members, even this is not enough. Simply setting a common goal and maintaining positive attitudes while raising your emotional intelligence will make you a better leader; but will it truly unlock your team's potential? </p>
<p>Instead of leadership traits, Agile leadership emphasizes facilitation and communication skills. This is teachable and much more powerful. This unique and effective leadership style challenges traditional beliefs in what leadership means.</p>
<p>Great leaders understand that the leader can no longer stand in the way of their team. Modern society, mindsets, and global competition demand new leadership roles, and leadership qualities all together that empower and motivate the team to new levels of productivity. Business leaders that miss this critical shift in leadership styles concede a powerful competitive advantage to the Agile leader. </p>
<p>In this course, you will learn how this new style of leadership redefines and redistributes team roles by: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motivating through empowerment to gain better decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the creativity and inclusivity of a high-functioning team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying and managing decision making biases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiating conflicts across individuals, teams, and organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring success through delegation and powerful constraint-based metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll learn to turn one internally motivated and critically thinking mind into many; and driving speed and innovation through leveraging all talents on the team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on Agile Process, Project, and Program Controls. </p>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

</ul>","<p>What do you want out of life? If you are like the vast majority of people who have been asked this question, your answer probably includes a desire to be happy. Often, though, we do not have a clear sense of what would make us happy. For more than thirty years, psychologists studying positive psychology have asked this very question: What makes people happy? And the research they have undertaken has provided clear answers.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the field of study known as positive psychology, which is the scientific study of “valued subjective experiences” such as happiness, well-being, satisfaction, hope, and optimism, as well as positive traits such as creativity, courage, and wisdom that contribute to meaning in life. Positive psychology focuses on the psychological states – contentment, happiness, and hope – individual traits – intimacy, creativity, integrity, altruism, and wisdom – and social institutions — schools and places of worship – that enable us to live our best life.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the history of positive psychology, beginning with the work of William James, continuing through the theory and research of contemporary positive psychologists. There is extensive coverage of the factors that determine our happiness, subjective well-being, and life satisfaction. Learners are given ample opportunities to engage in the activities that research has shown provide valuable self-care, including expressing gratitude, helping others, engaging in mindfulness, and finding meaning.</p>
<p>Later in the course, we present cross-cultural research on how well-being is measured across different societies and countries, cultural differences in desired levels of happiness, and how policy informs these factors. Last, research has demonstrated that helping others contributes to our levels of happiness. This course explains the factors that influence why we help, when we help, and how to increase helping behavior.</p>
<p>The course has a dual focus; in addition to learning about the field of positive psychology and its research findings, you will learn what proactive steps you can take to boost our own levels of happiness, well-being, and life satisfaction.</p>

A Culture of Health can help you to reduce costs, increase revenues and profits, and enhance your company’s reputation. </p>
<p>For example, employees who work in a healthy and safe environment spend less time away from work for health reasons, decreasing interruptions, while increasing output and employee retention. When employees and customers spend less on health care, they have more disposable income to spend on non–health care needs, boosting the economy, and benefiting your business. </p>

<p>Dr. Barbara Oakley—instructor of some of the most popular online courses of all time—and her co-instructor Olav Schewe, educational coach extraordinaire, have struggled in the past with their learning. But they’ve found ways to succeed—Barb has gone from a math-phobic failure in high school to become an engineering professor, and Olav has gone from a mediocre, muddling student to become a standout in his graduate studies at Oxford. In <em>Learn Like a Pro</em> , Olav and Barb lay out techniques based on easy-to-understand but cutting-edge neuroscientific research that can also help <em>you</em> master any material.</p>
<p><em>Learn Like a Pro</em> is like no other course on learning—it weaves late-breaking insights from neuroscience into Barb and Olav’s previous research and teaching to show unexpected, yet practical, new approaches. You’ll learn why note-taking <em>isn’t</em> always beneficial and why speed-reading techniques don’t work (they speed up only your eyes, not your brain—but there is something better you can do instead). You’ll also learn why the best strategies for learning a new language as an adult are inevitably different from the approaches you used as a child. And guess what? The same techniques you might use to boogie-down with dance or sink a basketball share can, with clever retooling, also help you gradually become an expert coder or master at chess. </p>

<li>Effectively maintain, troubleshoot and repair biomedical instruments</li>
<li>Sharpen the skill set of troubleshooting a biomedical instrument in a short period of time</li>
<li>Reduce the repair time and cost by using effective proven strategies and practices</li>
</ul>","<p>Maintaining and troubleshooting sophisticated medical instruments is not an easy task. In order to deliver effective care, the technician requires the knowledge of different aspects of biology and engineering. The different devices work in so many different ways and the literature about repair and troubleshooting is often hard to come by. It can be quite frustrating to search for solutions every time the operator encounters a problem. There is added pressure because the availability of medical devices is critical for therapeutic and diagnostic care. The longer a device stays out of operation, the slower the hospital would be able to deliver care to the patients.</p>
<p>This course has been designed by the interdisciplinary collaboration of both TU Delft biomedical engineers as well as the local expertise of the medical technicians of the Nick Simons Institute in Nepal to help new and emerging biomedical engineers/technicians working in low-income hospitals to care for biomedical equipment.</p>
<p>This course provides a compilation of the techniques hospitals use to effectively maintain and troubleshoot the medical devices so that repair time is reduced and the availability and safety of the medical devices is improved. Completing this course adds a complementary skill set to prior competence of the learner to perform maintenance routines and diagnose problems in sophisticated equipment with care. A faster service routine will help smoothen the process flow of the hospital and help extend the care to more patients.

<li>Use conceptual tools to follow the developments of human rights law.</li>
<li>Be an active participant in the global human rights movement, which brings together trade unions, NGOs, national human rights institutions, and activist lawyers from different world regions.</li>
</ul>","<p>Human rights have been defined as a concern of the international community since the post-Second World War period, when the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the prohibition of discrimination were included among the objectives of the newly established United Nations. They have significantly expanded their reach since: they now influence various branches of domestic law, including family law, employment law, corporate law, or criminal law. They also have influenced the shaping of international relations, in areas such as development cooperation, foreign debt, the global fight against terrorism, or the quest for sustainable development.</p>
<p>Governments remain the main actors in the development of human rights. Civil society (non-governmental organisations) and social movements, however, increasingly contribute to shaping their contours, and human rights are now evolving as a result of the constant dialogue between international human rights bodies and domestic courts, in a search that crosses geographical, cultural and legal boundaries. This course will explore how human rights evolve and how they can be enforced and progressively realized. It will examine the sources of human rights, including both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. It will address the specific regime of human rights law as part of general international law. It will relate the rights of individuals to the duties of States (to respect, protect and fulfil human rights). And it will assess the effectiveness of the mechanisms of protection of human rights, at both domestic and regional or international levels. </p>
<p>The course relies extensively on comparative material from different jurisdictions, to study a wide range of topics including, for instance, religious freedom in multicultural societies, human rights in employment relationships, economic and social rights in development, the human rights responsibilities of corporations, or human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism.</p>",2.2,10

<li>The common issues that arise in implementing community health worker programs at scale</li>
</ul>","<p>Despite medical and technological advances, half of the world’s population lacks access to essential health services, and over 8.9 million preventable deaths occur every year. There is an acute global shortage of health workers, a gap that will grow to 18 million by 2030. Studies show that training high-performing community health workers can help close these gaps and save more than 3 million lives annually.</p>
<p>In the past few decades, many community health worker programs across the world have demonstrated their ability to save lives — including in the hardest-to-reach areas. Yet despite this progress, lessons on how to successfully scale these programs as part of national primary health systems are not widely shared.</p>
<p>This course, developed in collaboration with the Community Health Academy at Last Mile Health, introduces learners to the core concepts of community health worker programs, and explores what is needed to build and strengthen large-scale programs in order to improve access to high-quality health services. The curriculum highlights the key components of designing community health systems, addresses common management challenges, and showcases lessons learned from a range of contributors — from community-level practitioners to government leaders and other global health experts. Through case studies of exemplar countries (including Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Liberia), participants will learn from leaders across the globe how to advocate for, build, and optimize community health worker programs.</p>
<p>This course was created by health systems leaders for health systems leaders. Whether you work in a Ministry of Health, lead or support a community health worker program, mobilize resources and advocate for increased investment in community health, or you are simply interested in knowing what it takes to deliver quality care through community health worker programs, learners will have the opportunity to advance their knowledge and skills to implement critical change. This course can be taken individually, but learners are also encouraged to convene their colleagues from within or across organizations to share insights and further enhance the learning experience.</p>

<li>Analyze your audience to determine the optimum balance of know-what, know-how, and know-why in your message design.</li>
</ul>","<p>“Everyone communicates, but few connect” is a famous book and message by John C. Maxwell on leadership. The meaning behind this message is that as leaders of programs and projects, we need to be not just communicators, but effective communicators.</p>
<p>Obtaining your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or similar project management certificate is the first step. But, as you gain program management and project management experience, you realize that effective communication goes beyond what you learned in ""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge"" (PMBOK). </p>
<p>Gaining a program management certification or project management certification (such as the PMP certification) equips you with the necessary project management tools to begin your project or project management career. There is more to effective program and project communication than what is on the PMP exam.</p>
<p>For communication from program managers and project managers to be truly effective, there must be understanding beyond what you learned from your professional certification. The communicator and the receiver must use feedback to determine how the message was received and if the communicator created the intended level of understanding in the receiver for the communication to succeed.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the Understanding Triad - know-what, know-how, and know-why. The Understanding Triad aids you in crafting just the right level of explanation for all your audiences. The Understanding Triad will make you a more effective program manager, traditional project manager, agile project manager, or certified scrum master.</p>
<p>The Project Management Institute, Inc (PMI) teaches that project management communication is the transfer of information. The project or program manager sends messages to their project teams, stakeholders, customers, and executive sponsors. If the program manager or project manager believes that communicating a clear message is enough for good communication, then the manager may be fooled into thinking their communication efforts are complete. Even if there is feedback, the feedback is usually limited to confirming that the message was received as intended. However, communication is not merely the transmission of information. The difference can be days, months, or years of wasted time and effort; or successful, early delivery.</p>
<p>Certified program and certified project managers earn 10 professional development units (PDU) as they learn how communication can make a difference in every interaction, and become a truly effective program or project manager. Gain the power skill of communication in this certificate program.</p>",1.3,10

</ul>","<p>We make thousands of decisions each day, though we may not always be consciously aware of each one. Many decisions seem straightforward—when to wake up, what to eat, what to wear, what activities to do—but research suggests that even simple decisions are influenced by other people and by the context in which the decisions are made. More significant decisions such as who we befriend, who we choose as a long-term partner, and what career we pursue are similarly influenced by psychological factors. ****</p>
<p>This course will separate the varied psychological factors that affect decisions into several categories. Some psychological factors are intrapersonal, meaning they occur in our own mind. These include cognitive factors such as schemas and attributions, and motivational factors such as the influence of psychological needs. Other factors are interpersonal, acknowledging that other people have powerful influences on our decisions. Another section focuses on the unique influence of group dynamics, suggesting our decisions are influenced by conformity, groupthink, and group polarization. Finally, we cover intergroup influences on decision making, such as prejudice and discrimination.</p>

<li>Making effective decisions from no data to big data (what should we collect and then what do we do with all this data?)</li>
</ul>","<p>Want to know how to avoid bad decisions with data?</p>
<p>Making good decisions with data can give you a distinct competitive advantage in business. This statistics and data analysis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of sound statistical thinking that can be applied in surprisingly wide contexts, sometimes even before there is any data! Key concepts like understanding variation, perceiving relative risk of alternative decisions, and pinpointing sources of variation will be highlighted.</p>
<p>These big picture ideas have motivated the development of quantitative models, but in most traditional statistics courses, these concepts get lost behind a wall of little techniques and computations. In this course we keep the focus on the ideas that really matter, and we illustrate them with lively, practical, accessible examples.</p>
<p>We will explore questions like: How are traditional statistical methods still relevant in modern analytics applications? How can we avoid common fallacies and misconceptions when approaching quantitative problems? How do we apply statistical methods in predictive applications? How do we gain a better understanding of customer engagement through analytics?</p>
<p>This course will be is relevant for anyone eager to have a framework for good decision-making. It will be good preparation for students with a bachelor's degree contemplating graduate study in a business field.</p>
<p>Opportunities in analytics are abundant at the moment. Specific techniques or software packages may be helpful in landing first jobs, but those techniques and packages may soon be replaced by something newer and trendier. Understanding the ways in which quantitative models really work, however, is a management level skill that is unlikely to go out of style.</p>

<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>
<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",2.6,12

<p>This course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project. </p>
<p>We’ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing. </p>
<p>Consider this course a survey of best practices: we’d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it’ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues. We look forward to seeing you in this course and the research you do in the future!</p>",3.9,16

<p>- Comprender la forma en la que se gesta un proyecto de Ciencia de Datos.</p>
<p>- Identificar los proyectos de esta disciplina que se pueden realizar en las diferentes áreas funcionales de una organización a través de casos de éxito en las diferentes industrias.</p>","<p>El futuro pertenece a la ciencia de datos y a quienes la entiendan. Al igual que el petróleo y el gas impulsaron las economías de los siglos XX y XXI, los datos impulsan cada vez mas la innovación y la economía global a medida que avanzamos hacia una nueva era denominada la revolución digital.</p>
<p>Las empresas que están cambiando a una mentalidad de datos van a obtener primero una enorme ventaja competitiva.</p>
<p>Esto se ha convertido en una verdad universal: las empresas modernas se están inundando de big data. El año pasado, McKinsey estimó que las iniciativas de Big Data en el sistema de salud de los Estados Unidos, ""podrían representar de $300 mil millones a $450 mil millones en gastos de salud reducidos o del 12 al 17 por ciento de la línea de base de $2.6 billones en costos de salud de los Estados Unidos"". Por otro lado, sin embargo se estima que los datos erróneos le cuestan a los Estados Unidos apróximadamente $3.1 trillones de dólares al año.</p>
<p>Aunque la ciencia de datos representará ventajas puntuales para las empresas como mitigar el riesgo y/o el fraude; entregar al cliente productos relevantes y tener experiencias personalizadas al mismo, es sin embargo, importante notar que la ciencia de datos podrá agregar un valor a cuaquier negocio, siempre y cuando pueda usar bien sus datos. El análisis de la información y la inteligencia de negocios ayudan a las organizaciones a tomar decisiones inteligentes basadas en el análisis de datos.</p>",3.6,9

Solid Waste Management,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/ed3aa6cc-9a82-4a39-965d-ef730ad95eb7-e9b5d1ed4563.jpeg,https://www.edx.org/learn/waste-management/world-bank-group-solid-waste-management,"<p>Solid waste is one of the most pressing issues of our time. World over, people are generating greater amounts of garbage without much thought. The phrase “out of sight, out of mind” holds true for many of us when it comes to waste issues. Once garbage leaves our homes and offices and factories, do we really consider what happens to it, who’s collecting it, or what impact it’s having on our environment and our health?</p>","<ul>
<li>Gain a solid understanding of core concepts of SWM, with a focus on municipal solid waste (MSW), and the importance of the sector on economic development and environmental protection</li>
<li>Evaluate various technology options based on the financial, technical, and operational capacities of each technology and treatment/disposal options</li>
<li>Distinguish between infrastructure (capex) and operations and maintenance (opex) costs, as related to various technologies, and gain insight into cost recovery methods; learn about various funding mechanisms to establish SMW projects</li>
<li>Examine various policy options at national and local levels to determine what would be most suitable given individual country and city scenarios and learn how institutions and coordination can improve service delivery and financial performance of the sector</li>
<li>Gain awareness of technological innovations in the sector, the key role of informal workers and women (particularly in low- and middle-income countries), and the changing perceptions of the waste sector towards resource management</li>
<li>Familiarize and apply solutions for improvement in the sector, while learning from practical examples and case studies</li>
</ul>","<p>Solid waste management (SWM) is a crucial function of local governments around the world, and directly affects public health, the environment, and livelihoods. However, rapid urbanization and population growth place multiple pressures on solid waste management systems, particularly in cities in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, the urban poor are most affected by lack of access to basic SWM services, such as waste collection and disposal.</p>
<p>Yet, the sector also provides numerous opportunities: Improving solid waste management provides a cleaner and healthier environment; improves livability for all city residents; and attracts new investment and tourism, which improve a city’s economic competitiveness, creating jobs, and new business opportunities. SWM also contributes to new sources of energy thus tackling climate change challenges. In these ways, SWM is directly relevant to the World Bank’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.</p>
<p>Historically, the highest expenditures of local governments is in the SWM sector but – particularly in low- and middle-income country cities – the bulk of expenses goes towards collection and transport instead of treatment and disposal. Another challenge is ensuring the financial sustainability of SWM projects and cost recovery once SWM infrastructure has been created. The world is generating increasing amounts of waste, with large amounts (primarily plastics) ending up in the oceans. However, there is also a paradigm shift from thinking about waste as something to be disposed – “out of sight out of mind” – to a resource that can be used for energy generation, reduce the use and costs associated with virgin resources, and improve our climate change efforts.</p>
<p>Given this background, this e-learning course is designed to look at the SWM sector, with a focus on MSW, from several angles in order to simplify concepts and promote understanding of this sector.</p>",1.4,8

<li>The benefits of mindfulness for helping you build resilience to stress, as well as innovation and team spirit at work</li>
<li>Research-based strategies for cultivating mindfulness within yourself and your organization</li>
</ul>","<p>Stress, anxiety, and burnout are rampant across workplaces today: 80 percent of workers feel stress on the job, and nearly half say they need help learning how to manage it. While many organizations may assume that intense stress is unavoidable, even admirable, research suggests that too much stress is toxic to our health and performance, leading to burnout and harming the culture of organizations as a whole.</p>
<p>This course offers research-based strategies for building resilience to stress and fortifying our well-being in the face of challenges. It explains the biological and psychological impact of stress, helps you distinguish between harmful and helpful forms of stress at work, and provides strategies for handling stress in healthy and productive ways.</p>
<p>The course zeroes in on the practice of mindfulness, the moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, and sensations that comes without judging those thoughts and feelings as good or bad. In recent years, there has been a surge in scientific research on mindfulness, with many studies documenting the value and advantages of fostering mindfulness in workplace settings. This course covers the landscape of mindfulness science, explains why it’s relevant to modern workplaces, and describes how it can be effectively folded into your workplace, drawing on case studies from several major companies that have implemented their own mindfulness programs.</p>
<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, introducing a half million students worldwide to research-based practices of mindfulness and related skills of stress reduction. In this course, they tailor their scientific insights to the needs of the modern workplace, highlighting stories of success from trailblazing organizations while also identifying challenges that workplaces may face as they try to foster mindfulness and resilience.</p>",1.3,20

These analytical tools are the ones most used by applied macroeconomists—including those at the IMF. You will learn both how to technically implement these tools and to interpret their results.</p>
<p>The course will guide you through the different sectors of an economy. It will present tools to assess the relevant sector and its vulnerabilities. These applied tools will be simple to apply and they will bring out the critical information that an economist needs to make an assessment.</p>
<p>Beyond the tools themselves, we’ll also be showing how to refine and interpret their output. We will be doing more than just plugging numbers into a spreadsheet formula. We will want to use the results of these tools – filtered through our judgement – to develop a narrative of a country’s economic situation.</p>
<p>To help you make this course more hands-on, you will be examining a case study country called “Diagnostica.” We will run through a series of sector-by-sector assessments. Along the way, we will be demonstrating how to apply the diagnostic by using different country examples. Then, you will be asked to perform that same exercise and interpret it for “Diagnostica.” Finally, we’ll be integrating our sectoral assessments into a comprehensive analysis known as a ‘risk assessment matrix’ or RAM. This will give us a sense of where the major risks and weaknesses lie in Diagnostica’s macroeconomic picture.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise alignment: how and why strategic plans, portfolio optimization, and project management canalign with simple metrics, with facilitative leadership</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Agile provides greater opportunities for control and risk management and offers unique benefits that traditional methods miss. As a project manager or program manager the emphasis should always be on delivering value and benefits. With complex projects these demand increase and knowing you've delivered value can be difficult for even those with years of project management experience. </p>
<p>However, in this course we'll cover the agile practices and management skills necessary to delivery value with certainty, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transparency with daily standup meetings discussing work status, risk, and pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a clear definition of done drives acceptance by all key stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measuring performance and benefits of working solutions during project delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iteratively testing to gain authentic feedback on solution requirements and stability.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Quality management principles to reduce project risk and technical debt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage and reduce interdependencies between project teams to scale programs at speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making the business case for agile contracts and how they ensure deliverables achieve business outcomes and objectives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, you will learn how these levers of control far exceed traditional management methods of earned value management (EVM), which relies on estimates and no changes in scope. We'll discuss how the key to unlocking the control potential is to learn what to manage, and how to measure it. It's no longer just ensure the deliverables are delivered on-time and under-budget.</p>
<p>This shift to benefits management is in-line with how the PMBOK is changing to integrate program management concerns into project management with an emphasis on value and not just delivery of scope specifications. The Agile revolution requires program managers to embrace this type of continuing education to advance and grow in your project management career. </p>
<p>So how do programs ensure smooth project delivery? </p>
<p>This answer is bottoms-up with different controls at each level of management, separating the concerns between the program, the individual projects, and the team processes. For teams, it’s a focus on team velocity and how to ensure its measurement is useful for diagnosing internal and external productivity constraints. For the project, the focus is on how to integrate teams of teams on related projects and ensure stead delivery of product roadmaps. For the program, the focus is on what capabilities are delivered and how to measure return on investment (ROI) capabilities provide. This also requires understanding your portfolio and contracting processes. </p>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope either completes your certificate with us or takes you to one of our most popular courses in the series, ""Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.""</p>

In an approachable style, you will learn how your physiology changes with age and how different types of movement can impact that trajectory of aging. Physical activity is a powerful medicine and you will learn how to harness its benefits to improve your health and wellness throughout the lifespan. Whether you are new to exercise or a life-long athlete, this class will open your eyes to the amazing systems within your body and help you strategize on activities that fit your goals for a healthy life.</p>
<p><strong>Note: This class is self-paced, so despite the ""One Session Start Date"" below, you can start any day you are ready. We look forward to seeing you online.</strong></p>","<p>You will learn about the physiology of aging and how your body adapts to physical activity in the following categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifestyle Activities</strong> – Like the lettuce in your salad, lifestyle activities will provide the foundation for your healthy lifestyle. Whether it is walking the dog or carrying your groceries, small changes throughout the day can make a difference in your overall health and function.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular System</strong> – Your heart, vessels and blood provide a network that delivers oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products, essentially keeping you alive. Optimizing the function of the cardiovascular system throughout your life will provide you with more energy, reduce your risk for disease and help you live longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Muscles</strong> – Preventing muscle loss as you age is critical to maintaining function and independence. Using your muscles regularly at all ages also reduces the risk for disease and premature mortality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bones</strong> – Often considered a “dead” tissue, bones are surprisingly responsive to the loads that are placed upon them. Keeping a healthy skeleton through physical activity can reduce the risk of debilitating fractures and osteoporosis later in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joints</strong> – Smooth, pain free joints are critical to continued movement throughout the lifespan, so keeping them functioning should be a priority. In contrast to what many people believe, moderate physical activity can help optimally maintain joints and actually reduce the risk for osteoarthritis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brain</strong> – One of the best things you can do to maintain your brain as you age is to engage in regular physical activity. New information is emerging every day as to how your brain and body are intimately connected through a bi-directional communication network. What is good for your body is good for your brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cellular Aging</strong> – Many of the benefits you see from physical activity at the whole body level are results of what is happening down in the individual cells. Physical activity can improve repair mechanisms, lengthen telomeres (an indicator of aging) and even reduce cell death. In essence, physical activity can make your cells appear and behave younger!</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Physical activity is a powerful medicine but, in the modern world, we have drifted away from incorporating activity into our lives. As the barriers to daily movement have gotten stronger, the burden to exercise has gotten greater. These challenges are made worse for individuals in midlife and beyond who experience physical impairments or who are new to regular physical activity. As scientists learn more about the pathways of disease, the causes of aging and the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its benefits, better strategies to slow (i.e. “hack”) the aging process have also emerged. The benefits of exercise impact nearly every area of health and disease that older individuals are concerned about including the risk for dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, obesity, diabetes and more. Through a series of informative lectures by Anne Friedlander, you will learn how your body normally changes with age and how physical activity can be used to slow that trajectory of aging. The science of exercise will be explained in combination with practical tips (such as how much and what kind), so that you can harness the power of physical activity to optimize healthy aging.</p>",3.1,10

<p>As an agile problem solver, you'll need to expand your critical thinking skills to address the key sources of risk in developing best solutions for your new products and business lines. The Problem-solving techniques covered begin with problem definition, beginning with job descriptions and applying the right soft skills to enhance requirements gathering. This ensures you're targeting a good problem to solve, and that you understand the business model. The course then moves on to practices such as ""brainstorm and storm drain"" to target new creative solutions. You will learn how innovation works on fast feedback cycles to test possible solutions and target root causes of defects. Creative thinking isn't a straight line, and neither should the problem-solving process be a straight line. Each course of action needs early and frequent testing.</p>
<p>Key lessons taught in this course are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Delivering business value, not technical scope with User Stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why innovating is the key to risk management and gaining a competitive advantage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best innovation process for startups in new markets or disruptive innovations, versus sustaining product and process innovations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to employ an innovation process that fits your business model and situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Cross-functional teams and user stories to gather accurate requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging constraints to apply tested solutions to new technology and new innovations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying Test-Driven Design (TDD) to deliver better designs with less designing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following best practices of Agile, including timeboxes, constraint-based thinking processes, and empathetic problem solving, you'll learn how to provide a sustainable innovation environment for your teams.</p>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile innovation is accomplished in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.”</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).</p>",3.5,13

Program and project teams and leaders, need to understand what matters and how their work connects to the greater whole.</p>
<p>Storytelling is not a part of the Project Management Institute, Inc's (PMI) ""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' (PMBOK). Storytelling is not something that Certified Associate In Project Management (CAPM), Project Management Professional (PMP), PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP), certified scrum masters, or other certified project manager credential holders will encounter on an exam. Storytelling is something that successful program or project managers learn from years of experience. If storytelling is not on the PMP exam or similar project management certification exams, why should you bother learning how to tell good stories?</p>
<p>Because, human brains are naturally designed for stories. We have brain structures devoted to making sense of the world in cause-effect terms. Good stories are like flight simulators in that you can try out various approaches to a problem before tackling the real problem. Risk management for programs and projects is more effective when using compelling narratives. Stories are also effective ways to transmit large amounts of information to your project teams and stakeholders. People can remember more information and act effectively on that information. For agile project management, stories are how customers communicate their requirements to the agile project team. Stories are the foundation of persuasive communication and will help you become an expert communicator.</p>

Quelles sont les options pour transformer nos modes de vie dans la perspective d'un développement plus respectueux des limites planétaires ?</p>
<p>Dans ce cours, nous abordons ces questions selon une approche scientifique et universitaire. En faisant intervenir des expert.es de différents domaines (le droit, la philosophie, l'ingénierie, le management, l'agronomie, l'économie, la médecine...), ce MOOC vous invite à développer des connaissances approfondies sur les enjeux du développement durable et de la transition, à comprendre les éléments en tension qui suscitent le débat et à développer le recul critique nécessaire pour mettre ces points de tension en perspective.</p>
<p>L'approche interdisciplinaire retenue dans ce cours nous semble indispensable pour s'approprier les enjeux du développement durable de manière transversale. Chaque discipline apporte un type de diagnostic sur les enjeux sociaux et environnementaux et sur leurs causes, puis ouvre la porte à des pistes d'actions et de solutions spécifiques. C'est en faisant dialoguer ces différentes disciplines que nous pourrons faire progresser les connaissances et la société dans le sens d'un développement plus durable, plus inclusif, plus juste. Ainsi, la valeur ajoutée de ce cours réside dans les liens que vous pourrez établir entre les différents sujets abordés.</p>
<p>Les connaissances sur les enjeux du développement durable sont nombreuses et évoluent constamment. Ce cours ne prétend pas en faire le tour complet mais il vous invite à plonger dans la vaste étendue des travaux scientifiques qui cherchent à faire progresser la société sur ces sujets.</p>",3.6,17

Learn basic coding tools to help save time and draw insights from thousands of digital documents at once.</p>,"<p>By the end of this course, learners will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand which digital methods are most suitable to meaningfully analyze large databases of text</li>
<li>Identify the resources needed to complete complex digital projects and learn about their possible limitations</li>
<li>Download existing datasets and create new ones by scraping websites and using APIs</li>
<li>Enrich metadata and tag text to optimize the results of your analysis</li>
<li>Analyze thousands of books with digital methods such as topic modeling, vector models, and concept search</li>
<li>Test your knowledge by writing and editing code in Python, and use these skills to explore new methods of search</li>
</ul>","<p>From the printing press to the typewriter, there is a long history of scholars adapting to new technologies. In the last forty or fifty years, the most significant advance has been the digitization of books. We now have whole libraries—centuries of history, literature, and philosophy—available instantaneously. This new access is a wonderful benefit, but it can also be overwhelming. If you have hundreds of thousands of books available to you in an instant, where do you even start? With a bit of elementary code, you can study all of these books at once, and derive new sorts of insights.</p>
<p>Computation is changing the very nature of how we do research in the humanities. Tools from data science can help you to explore the record of human culture in ways that just wouldn’t have been possible before. You’re more likely to reach out to others, to work across disciplines, and to assemble teams. Whether you're a student wanting to expand your skillset, a librarian supporting new modes of research, or a journalist who has just received a massive cache of leaked e-mails, this course will show you how to draw insights from thousands of documents at once. You will learn how, with a few simple lines of code, to make use of the metadata—the information about our objects of study—to zero in on what matters most, and visualize your results so that you can understand them at a glance.</p>
<p>In this course, you’ll work on building parts of a search engine, one tailor-made to the needs of academic research. Along the way, you'll learn the fundamentals of text analysis: a set of techniques for manipulating the written word that stand at the core of the digital humanities.</p>
<p>By the end of the course, you will be able to apply what you learn to what interests you most, be it contemporary speeches, journalism, caselaw, and even art objects. This course will analyze pieces of 18th-century literature, showing you how these methods can be applied to philosophical works, religious texts, political and historical records – material from across the spectrum of humanistic inquiry.</p>
<p>Combine your traditional research skills with data science to find answers you never might have expected.</p>",3.1,7

Perry and a team of international experts explore what can be done about the threat of nuclear terrorism in this free course, for which you can earn a signed Statement of Accomplishment. This is a self-paced version of the original course which ran in Fall 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to ""The Threat of Nuclear Terrorism""</strong></p>
<p>""Today, the danger of some sort of nuclear catastrophe is greater than it was during the Cold War, and most people are blissfully unaware of this danger.""</p>
<p>I wrote these words three years ago, and my concern led me to create my first Stanford Online course, ""Living at the Nuclear Brink."" Our nuclear peril continues to increase, and therefore I offer the next in our series of free courses on this vital subject: The Threat of Nuclear Terrorism. The topic is frightening, but it is one we must face if we are to have any chance of stopping potential catastrophe.</p>","<p><strong>Course Instructors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. William J. Perry</strong> was the 19th Secretary of Defense for the United States, serving from February 1994 to January 1997.

He is also a Research Scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy (CISSM).</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Joseph Martz</strong> is a physicist and 35-year employee of Los Alamos National Laboratory, who has focused on issues surrounding nuclear security, nuclear weapons, and stockpile stewardship. His early work led to a nationwide evaluation and repackaging of stored nuclear materials, and he was a co-developer of the ARIES system, a means to dismantle and safely recover plutonium from excess nuclear weapons. In addition to his research at Los Alamos, Dr. Martz has led national project teams, including the recent reliable-replacement warhead design competition and several complex nuclear material experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen O’Kane Tauscher</strong> represented California’s 10th Congressional District in the East Bay of San Francisco for seven terms from 1997-2009. She served on the House Armed Services Committee and was Chair of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, overseeing the nuclear weapons stockpile and complex, among other forces, from 2006-2009. In 2009, Tauscher was nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher was responsible for successfully closing negotiations of the New Start Treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010 in Geneva and representing the United States at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference at the United Nations in May 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alex Wellerstein</strong> is an Assistant Professor of Science and Technology Studies (STS) in the College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. Dr. Wellerstein has been an Associate Historian (a postdoctoral position) at the Center for the History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics, as well as a postdoctoral fellow at the Managing the Atom Project (MTA) and the International Security Program at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School of Government.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Plame Wilson</strong> : As a former career covert CIA operations officer, Valerie Plame Wilson worked to protect America’s national security and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons. During her career with the CIA, Valerie managed top-secret covert programs designed to keep terrorists and rogue nation states from acquiring nuclear weapons. Her position involved decision-making at senior levels, recruiting foreign assets, deploying resources around the world, managing multi-million dollar budgets, briefing U.S. policymakers, and demonstrating consistently solid judgment in a field where mistakes could prove disastrous to national security.</p>","<p>Is the threat of nuclear terrorism real? Listen to Graham Allison, Martha Crenshaw, David Holloway and Joe Martz as they investigate the evidence with myself and selected Stanford students. What would be the consequences of a nuclear terror attack? The scenario is difficult to imagine, but Alex Wellerstein and Lynn Eden help me and our students understand just what could happen if the worst case occurs, and how we can work to limit the damage. What can we do to prevent or mitigate this risk? Participate as I explore this crucial question with the help of Stephen Flynn, Rachel Bronson, Valerie Plame Wilson, Ellen Tauscher and Jeffrey Lewis.</p>
<p>With the expert help of Stanford Online, we are able to bring to you this unprecedented group of experts from a wide variety of fields, who share a strong commitment to the urgency of educating people on this important topic.

<p>As we create more data-driven technologies, those issues become increasingly urgent. We must begin to ask not only ‘what can we do?’, but also ‘what should we do?’ How should we design new technologies to make sure they are used for good, not bad purposes?</p>
<p>The ‘good’, the ‘bad’, and the ‘should’ are a domain of ethics, and a basis for other important concepts such as justice, fairness, rights, respect. They further inform the law and what is legal. Finally, they are at the roots of an extremely important currency in the modern economy: trust.</p>
<p>This story-driven course is taught by the leading experts in data science, AI, information law, science and technology studies, and responsible research and innovation, and informed by case studies supplied by digital business frontrunners and tech companies. We will look at real-world controversies and ethical challenges to introduce and critically discuss the social, political, legal and ethical issues surrounding data-driven innovation, including those posed by big data, AI systems, and machine learning systems. We will drill down into case studies, structured around core concerns being raised by society, governments and industry, such as bias, fairness, rights, data re-use, data protection and data privacy, discrimination, transparency and accountability. Throughout the course, we will emphasise the importance of being mindful of the realities and complexities of making ethical decisions in a landscape of competing interests.</p>
<p>We will engage with data-based contexts such as facial recognition, predictive policing, medical screening, smart homes and cities, banking, and AI, to explore their social implications and the tools required to minimise harm, promote fairness, and safeguard and increase human autonomy and well-being.

<li>Kanban boards to limit work-in-progress (WIP) in a timebox</li>
<li>Time boxing activities to eliminate delays and gain schedule advances and ensure team capacity </li>
<li>Application and iteration of the Pareto Principle for product backlog refinement</li>
<li>Rolling Wave Planning and to ensure you deliver on the big picture</li>
</ul>","<p>Speed is by far the most sought-after benefit of Agile.</p>
<p>First mover advantages, the economic cost of delays, and the enabling effect on innovation drive the search for speed. Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>In this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.</p>
<p>In this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.</p>
<p>While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Agile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills.”</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).</p>",1.8,8

A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the nonlinear data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>You will explore the hierarchical data structure of trees. Trees have important properties such as shape and order which are used to categorize trees into different groups and define their functionality. The course begins by explaining Binary Trees and two subgroups: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Binary Heaps. You will program BSTs, their operations and traversal algorithms. BSTs are an important structure when wanting to access information quickly. Heaps approach access differently and prioritize what data is accessed. Heaps also employ the concept of up-heap and down-heap operations not found in other structures.</p>
<p>HashMaps and SkipLists are the last data structures discussed in the course. The HashMap ADT is a collection of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are stored in an unordered manner based on hash codes and compression functions that translate keys into integers. You will investigate different collision strategies and implement one. SkipLists are a probabilistic data structures where data is placed in the structure based on a randomization procedure.</p>
<p>The course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade. Lastly, you'll complete a course exam, which counts for the remaining 30% of your grade.</p>",2.2,19

<li><strong>Determining your target customer.</strong> It all begins with target customers who will ultimately decide how well your product meets their needs. You should use market segmentation to get specific about who your target customer is.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying underserved customer needs.</strong> After forming your hypothesis about your target customers, the next step is to understand their needs. As you try to create value for customers, you want to identify the specific needs that correspond to a good market opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Defining your value proposition.</strong> Your value proposition is your plan for how your product will meet customer needs better than the alternatives. Out of all the potential customer needs your product could address, which ones will you focus on with your product?</li>
<li><strong>Specifying your MVP feature set.</strong> Once you are clear on your value proposition, you need to specify what functionality your minimum viable product will include. The MVP approach is aimed at building only what is needed to create enough value in the eyes of your target customer to validate that you are heading in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>Creating your MVP prototype.</strong> In order to test your MVP hypotheses with customers, you need to show them a version of your product so they can give you feedback on it. You will need to apply user experience (UX) design to bring your feature set to life for your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Testing your MVP with customers.</strong> Once you have your MVP prototype ready, it’s time to test it with customers. It’s important in this step to ensure the people from whom you are soliciting feedback are in your target market..</li>
<li><strong>Iterating to Improve Product-Market Fit.</strong> The Lean Product Process is an iterative process. After analyzing the customer feedback, you want to revise your hypotheses based on what you learned and loop back to an earlier step in the process.</li>
</ul>","<p>Entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen coined the term product-market fit in 2007 when he said, “Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” While there are ample articles that mention the term, detailed guidance on how to actually achieve product-market fit is scarce.</p>
<p>Through our course we will explore an actionable model that defines product-market fit using five key components. From bottom to top, we will examine the layers of product-market fit beginning with your target customer and transitioning through your customer’s underserved needs, your value proposition, your feature set, and ultimately your user experience (UX).</p>
<p>Our process is an iterative, easy-to-follow guide through each layer to achieve product-market fit. This process helps you to articulate, test, and revise your key hypotheses about your product and the market so you can define and improve your product-market fit.</p>
<p>Using the principles of Lean Product Process, our course is structured in seven steps: determining your target customer, identifying underserved customer needs, defining your value proposition, specifying your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set, creating your MVP prototype, testing your MVP with customers, and iterating to improve product-market fit.</p>",1.4,16

Special interest groups resemble political parties, but while parties try to influence elections, groups concentrate on gaining influence over policies. Meanwhile, social movements take place outside these established institutions, often in the form of protest demonstrations and rallies. All of these interests are filtered through the news media, which plays a critical role in shaping people’s images of politics. </p>
<p>This course will help you to understand how these forces shape American politics, from “invisible primaries” to election day and beyond.</p>",2.8,20

<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>. Differentiate the different estimate types used in small and large projects during planning and design.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling</strong>. In project construction management the schedule is most commonly used to track the project. By systematically analyzing each activity and its relationship to the activities that come before and after it, the construction manager can build a project on paper before committing resources to it. <ul>
<li>The uses of schedules and types of scheduling methods.</li>
<li>How the schedule is a powerful construction management and communication tool. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Controls</strong>. Project control begins with the identification of the owner’s objectives and ends when those objectives have been met. Project control is a continuous cycle in which construction managers identify a goal, measure results, analyze and make adjustments, and report results. After a construction project has been completed the team responsible for carrying out the work usually split up and go to various other jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>. The administrative tools used to manage, control, and document the construction management process. Jobsite administration requires diligence for clear procedures and understanding of the importance of recordkeeping.</li>
<li><strong>Law</strong>. The legal rules that govern the design and construction management processes. Construction law is made up of specialized rules and regulations that govern how people behave in the context of a construction project.

This is the first step on the path to computer engineering.</p>","<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build digital systems at levels of abstraction from transistors through circuits and logic.</li>
<li>Manage complexity using the digital abstraction, static and dynamic disciplines, and hierarchical design.</li>

<li>Begin the practice of implementing and debugging digital systems with appropriate lab techniques including breadboarding and interpreting datasheets.</li>
<li>Simulate digital circuits with a free version of ModelSim, a professional simulation tool.</li>
</ul>","<p>Digital systems have revolutionized our world. From television to cell phones to GPS to warfare to automobiles to medicine to distance education, computers and digital processing have reshaped the way we live and work. The semiconductor industry has grown from $21B in 1985 to $412B in 2019, making it one of the largest sectors of the economy. Computers are also a vital part of daily practice in every field of science and engineering.</p>
<p>Previous generations of engineers learned the “nuts and bolts” of the profession by doing hand-on projects such as disassembling and rebuilding engines. As technology has advanced, cars have become too complicated for the average person to work on. Ironically, the same advances have made computers much easier to build. While most fields of engineering require extensive mathematics and complicated analysis of even rather simple components, digital systems merely require counting from 0 to 1. Their challenge, instead, is in combining many simple building blocks into a complex whole. In this class, you will experiment with digital systems, building simple circuits from logic gates on a breadboard and designing more complex systems with a logic simulator. You will learn how to systematically create digital systems with a desired function. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and experience to design digital systems and be prepared for more advanced coursework.</p>
<p>Beyond the practical reasons to take this class, I hope you find it enormously fun and exciting like I do. There's a great satisfaction about being able to build things. Digital systems are ideal because the components are far cheaper and easier to use than in other engineering fields. It's also amazing to demystify how digital systems work under the hood. I fell in love with digital design when I first studied it in college, and I hope you do too!</p>
<p>This is the first half of a 2-part sequence. This half covers digital design. The second half, ENGR85B, covers computer architecture, where you will learn to program, use, and build microprocessors. By the end of the second half, you will have designed your own microprocessor and understand it all the way from the transistor level to the software. You'll also have built smart gadgets and games with lights and sensors.</p>",2.3,8

Sustainable Building with Timber,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/9b46f7bb-a8ca-4dbd-87db-989ec2af7306-f6e3b7050644.png,https://www.edx.org/learn/architecture/delft-university-of-technology-building-with-timber,"<p>Innovations in architecture, engineering and manufacturing make it feasible to construct almost any building in timber, including high-rise structures. Discover how this way of building could help solve our climate, resource and housing related challenges.</p>","<ul>
<li>Gain fresh insights into the importance of building sustainably with timber from well-managed forests</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the environmental impact and carbon footprint of timber constructions</li>
<li>Analyze and identify circular timber building design typologies</li>
<li>Evaluate the cohesion and stability of timber load-bearing structures</li>
<li>Examine the building physics and design qualities of modern timber buildings</li>
<li>Discuss the benefits of prefabrication and building processes</li>
</ul>","<p>The way we construct our buildings needs to change! Over 35% of our global greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the built environment. A third of that amount is specifically related to the production of abiotic (non-renewable) materials such as concrete, metals and plastics. The associated challenges are not only climate related, but also concern resource scarcity, health and housing provision.</p>
<p>A viable alternative to our current construction paradigm is building with timber. Recent advances in the capabilities of timber manufacturing offer opportunities for large-scale application in the build environment, whilst also going much of the way to solving the aforementioned challenges.</p>
<p>In this course you will learn how we can – and why we should – support the greater use of timber in our built environment by implementing a combined 'sustainable forestry' and 'timber for construction' supply chain.</p>
<p>Sustainable forest management allows us to use timber while preserving forests by taking ecological and social, as well as economic factors into account. Sustainably sourced timber can store carbon, both in forests and in buildings.</p>
<p>Timber is also an ideal material for prefabrication, which allows us to shift the bulk of construction labor to manufacturing halls and make the building process itself cleaner, quicker, of a higher quality, and less of a nuisance on-site.</p>
<p>Additionally, an ideal timber construction process should incorporate circular building practices allowing us to re-use timber structures at individual building and regional level.</p>
<p>Overall, when compared with traditional construction based on heavy abiotic materials, this will result in healthier buildings which store carbon instead of emitting it, while the raw resource grows back in sustainably managed temperate forests.</p>
<p>This course is relevant for all stakeholders in the built environment – architects, developers, engineers, consultants and policymakers – as well as students who want to learn more about the opportunities and cutting-edge best practices for designing and building with timber.</p>
<p>This course has been developed by TU Delft’s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment and the Circular Built Environment Hub, in collaboration with VIA University College Denmark, FSC Netherlands, the AMS Institute, Ssse | OvO associates architects, Lister Buildings, Material District and geWOONhout in the context of the HOME for the future project.</p>

<li>Choose the appropriate detail view and information to show for each stakeholder (specialty)</li>
<li>Communicate effectively about façade design to aid a more integrated design process</li>
<li>Confidently apply general concepts in façade design to future designs (i.e. structural, building physics, and construction)</li>
</ul>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Façades are the most visible part of a building, yet they do not receive the attention they deserve in education </span> – and they should! Façades play an important role in creating a healthy indoor environment, contribute to sustainable building practices, and are key in reducing operational costs due to their potential longevity. Above all, they can give a building the beautiful look that sets it apart from any other in the surroundings.</p>
<p>International experts from TU Delft, TU Darmstadt and Eurac Research have teamed up to create a series of courses on façades engineering to close this knowledge gap. This course will provide you with an in-depth exploration of façade detailing, with a focus on a stick façade system. This entails deciding on the system, the material and the connection between the façade and the building in the design process. Get it wrong and the façade will leak or worse still, break!</p>
<p>We are going to do it in a thorough and practical way. You will be guided step-by-step through the development process of façade details using an example. You will gain knowledge of detailing, stick systems, and the materials available for these systems. You will learn to interpret façade details, and <span lang=""EN-US"">draw the typical details of a stick-system façade, which will demonstrate your understanding of how the various fields impact the design. While we focus on only one type of façade system, our aim is to provide you with enough confidence to begin applying structural, building physics, and construction concepts to the detail drawings of other façade systems.</span></p>
<p>The course is developed for (aspiring) architectural engineers who seek more information about, and practice with, façade detailing. Here we understand the detailing process as the individual technical design development of an engineer, composing various technical solutions to fulfill various functions of façades.

But how would this mysterious figure have been understood in Shakespeare’s time? </p>
<p>Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt guides learners through an exploration of the Ghost’s uncanny theatrical power and the historical contexts from which the character emerged. You will be introduced to the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and how the Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. By focusing on the Ghost, you will see how the play grapples with issues like death, mourning, remembrance, and the power of theatre. </p>
<p>Through short video lectures, readings from the play as well as later works by Coleridge and Joyce, and conversations with experts, you will develop critical tools with which to ""unlock"" the play's possible meanings. </p>

<p>“Big data”, “data science”, “data-mining” and “artificial intelligence” are all popular terms that are often encountered nowadays in the academic and in business worlds.</p>
<p>Computer Science is a field where the usage of computers and “computations” have continuously evolved. As computational power increases, computation becomes an indispensable tool for solving complex problems and making predictions. We are now able to “compute” various things from DNA sequencing to aerodynamics simulations and weather forecasting.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn the essence of computer science. You will obtain an overview of cutting-edge computer science as well as learn the basics and introductory level knowledge of computer science, while experiencing, designing and writing your own simple programs. This revised course consists of 5 weekly units. A separate course covering the same content is also offered where the lectures are given in Japanese. </p>
<p>The course begins by introducing the notion of computation and data and how things work inside a computer. Before jumping into advanced topics like encryption and cryptanalysis, we will discover important notions like ""arrays"", ""characters"" and ""strings"" and we will know more about functions and subroutines throughout the lectures. Along the way we will practice with exercises to have a hands-on experience and deeper understanding of the explained notions. All exercises have files that can be downloaded and used. A detailed explanation about setting up the environment to run the programs using the language Ruby is provided at the beginning of the course.</p>

</ul>","<p>Can cancer risk be reduced through a healthy diet or lifestyle? Many studies have been conducted on the role of nutrition and physical activity in cancer prevention. This has resulted in recommendations for cancer prevention. Far less research is conducted on nutrition and cancer progression, but the evidence is increasing that a healthy diet may also play a beneficial role for cancer survivors. Join this online course and learn more about the role of nutrition in the occurrence and progression of cancer. You will learn how nutrition is involved in cancer occurrence, cancer treatment, and progression. And you will discover what the evidence-base is for dietary guidelines.</p>
<p>This online course focuses on a wide range of dietary exposures (including vegetables, meat, dietary supplements, alcohol) and lifestyle factors (including body composition and physical activity) in relation to the occurrence and progression of the most common types of cancer, such as large bowel cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer.</p>
<p><strong>For whom?</strong></p>
<p>Dieticians and physicians often get questions from cancer patients about what they can do themselves to help their recovery process. After completing the course you will have gained a solid scientific basis to better weigh and interpret all the information available on nutrition and cancer and to take care of your own health and/or that of your patients.</p>

</ul>","<p>This course takes you through the first eight lessons of CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction as taught in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. </p>
<p>In this course, you’ll take the first steps toward being a solid HCI practitioner and researcher. You’ll learn the fundamentals of how HCI relates to fields like user experience design, user interface design, human factors engineering, and psychology. You’ll also learn how human-computer interaction has influence across application domains like healthcare and education; technology development like virtual and augmented reality; and broader ideas like context-sensitive computing and information visualization. </p>
<p>You’ll then dive into the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. You’ll learn three views of the user’s role in interface design: the behaviorist ‘processor’ view, the cognitivist ‘predictor’ view, and the situationist ‘participant’ view. You’ll discover how these different views of the user’s role affect the scope we use to evaluate interaction. These perspectives will be crucial as you move forward in designing interfaces to ensure you’re considering what goes on inside the user’s head, as well as in the environment around them. </p>
<p>You’ll then learn the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which determine how easily the user can accomplish their goals in a system and how well they can understand the results of their actions. All of user interface design can be seen as taking steps to bridge these gulfs. You’ll also investigate the notion of direct manipulation, which shortens the distance between the user and the objects they are manipulating in the interface. With these tools, you’ll be well-equipped to start designing effective interfaces. </p>
<p>You’ll then take a deeper dive into what humans are even capable of accomplishing. You’ll learn the limitations of human sensing and memory and how we must be aware of the cognitive load we introduce on the user while using our interfaces. Cognitive load can have an enormous impact on a user’s satisfaction with an interface, and must be kept in mind as you begin your career as a designer. </p>
<p>You’ll finally conclude with an overview of the major design principles in human-computer interaction. Curated from the work of Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Ronald Mace, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood, these design principles cover revolutionary ideas in the design of interfaces: discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, constraints, error tolerance, and more. These principles are crucial whether you move forward as a designer, an evaluator, a front-end engineer, or any other role in technology design. </p>
<p>By the end of the course, you’ll have an understanding of where HCI sits in the broader field, a grasp of the goals of HCI, and a foundation in core principles that inform interface design.</p>",2.3,12

<li>analyze asylum claims in details.</li>
</ul>","<p>What is asylum?<br />
What is the principle of non-refoulement?<br />
Who should be recognized and protected as a refugee?</p>
<p>These questions are both ancient and contemporary.</p>
<p>Whether you are a decision maker, a judge, a lawyer, a human rights activist, a student, a lawyer in the business law department of a private company that wants to hire or assist refugees, you will have to answer these questions. The answers are complex. They require precise theoretical and practical knowledge of national, regional and international law.</p>
<p>The 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees will enable you to master these questions. This Convention remains the cornerstone of international refugee protection. It is at the heart of this online course. You will analyze in detail the principle of non-refoulement, the definition of a refugee and the causes of persecution such as political opinion, race, nationality, religion or membership of a social group.</p>
<p>This definition will allow you to identify the people who, legally, should be recognized as beneficiaries of refugee status and international protection. Using a conceptual tool, <em>the three-scale theory</em> , you will analyze in a rigorous and structured manner each distinct element of the refugee definition (persecution, risk, proof) as well as, in a comprehensive approach, the definition as a whole.</p>
<p>By confronting theoretical analysis with practical situations, you will see that, if correctly interpreted, the Geneva Convention remains effective and still allows to this day the protection of many fugitives or refugees ( <em>Flüchtling, réfugiés</em> ).</p>
<p>Beyond law, you will understand the value of an interdisciplinary approach, in particular when measuring the credibility of an asylum seeker’s narrative.<br />
You will examine the importance of regional, subsidiary or complementary protection in addressing armed conflict, events seriously disturbing public order or mass influxes of people in need of international protection. Regional protections find their source in European Law, African law or American Law.<br />
Finally, you will look at future challenges, such as the issue of climate refugees.</p>
<p>Numerous sources will be provided throughout the course in order to help you understand the concepts such as relevant case-law, doctrine and guidelines of UNHCR and other international institutions on refugee issues and international human rights law (such as EASO).</p>
<p>In this course, Asylum and Refugee Law, you will learn whether or not migrants can be returned to another country, whether or not they should be included in or excluded from the refugee definition, and whether or not to challenge the decision on someone’s refugee status. You will do all of this by developing a rigorous legal reasoning.</p>",2.6,18

Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu'il s'agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d'intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…</p>
<p>Ce cours s'éloigne de l'approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L'approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raiffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l'information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiantes et étudiants une compréhension fine et detaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.</p>",4.0,15

<ul>
<li>translate a real mechanical system into a multibody model;</li>
<li>complete your model with features and sub-models that are specific to your application;</li>
<li>build and master a program (in Python, Matlab or C) to time simulate the system;</li>
<li>produce the expected results.</li>
</ul>","<p>This course aims at acquainting you with the modeling and simulation of complex articulated mechanical systems, denoted as multibody systems, such as vehicles, merry-go-rounds, motorbikes, cranes, human bodies, suspensions, robot manipulators, mechanical transmissions, etc.</p>
<p>This course is based on (1) video clips focusing on the main theoretical background and concepts, (2) well-illustrated written sections giving more details about the mathematical formulation, and (3) questions, exercises and modeling projects.</p>
<p>Despite the intrinsic complexity of such systems in terms of morphology and motions, basic skills in Newtonian mechanics, linear algebra and numerical methods are sufficient to model them, provided that the endless and tedious computation related to their internal kinematics and dynamics are at our disposal. This is the purpose of the symbolic program ROBOTRAN*, which can be used with this course and can automatically generate the full set of equations of motion of MBS, in a symbolic manner, i.e. exactly as if you were writing them by hand, whatever the size and the morphological complexity of the application. Hence, this course will instead teach you how to intervene upstream and downstream this generation step.</p>
<p>Upstream the latter, you will learn how to translate a real system, e.g. a car suspension, into a virtual multibody model comprising bodies, joints, internal or external forces and torques and imposed motion… with a level of refinement that will be dictated by the original issue. For example, what is the minimum tire ground force when the car suspension is excited by a shaker?</p>
<p>Downstream the symbolic generation, your intervention will consist in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing the symbolic model with features that are specific to your system, e.g. a tire force model or the tuning of a motion controller, among other things;</li>
<li>Implementing under the form of a program (in Python, Matlab, or C) a time simulation to solve the differential equations of motion, given the original question: e.g. find the transient motion of the system submitted to forces and torques and compute a specific force time history or the maximal acceleration of a particular point.</li>
<li>Selecting the most suitable results, including self-explanatory - and sometimes funny - video animations of your multibody system in motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, this course, based on the use of the ROBOTRAN* symbolic generator, will allow you to focus on the most interesting aspects of the multibody modeling process, by entirely mastering your computer model from the input data to the results, instead of using a black-box multibody software that clearly goes against the educational objective of this course. </p>
<p>Enjoy Multibody Dynamics! </p>
<p>*Note: The course was built to teach modeling and simulation of multibody systems, and not to teach any specific software. However, we suggest that you use the symbolic ROBOTRAN program to model and study the various multibody systems proposed in this course.</p>",2.9,9

And depending on the design, they must consider the many factors that affect the reliability of those observations and the validity of any conclusions that might be drawn from them. This course considers all these and many other aspects of psychological research. A large segment of this course is then devoted to issues related to how psychologists ensure that the research methods they employ are ethical. Everyone would agree that ethical considerations are one of the most important things researchers must think about when they plan their studies, but it’s also one of the most invisible in reports on psychological research. Any article that reports the results of a psychological study provides voluminous details about the methodology, about issues like sampling and validity, for instance, but little if any mention of the relevant ethical issues, even though there are ethical issues in play at every step of the process. Behind all the fascinating research in the psychological literature are rules, regulations, and expectations about how the people or animals we study will be treated, and about how the data we collect will be analyzed and reported. And behind all those standards are more general principles that have been established from grim experience that includes some of the worst things humans have ever done in the name of science, and other missteps that hindsight tells us we don’t want to repeat. In this course, we investigate that history and abstract from it those principles that now guide ethical decisions about how to do research. To what goals do those principles aspire? And what breaches are they meant to keep us from repeating?</p>",2.4,9

As your products grow, you’ll also need to skills to manage teams of teams. This course will enable you to align product teams, product designs, and product development for speed and innovation at scale.</p>
<p>Product Managers have one of the toughest, most demanding positions in the modern product organization. They must be both visionaries and evangelists, as well as facilitators and coaches. Often they must communicate clearly and effectively across a wide range of audiences. To do this well means being the expert in a number of key competencies of leadership.</p>
<p>Modern leadership principles emphasize empowerment and ownership. Meanwhile products require teams to work together at scale. This course will starts by resetting on what is good leadership based on actual data and studies. Not half-proven theories or intuition. Drawing on actual research and met studies we’ll cover the key elements of what makes a good product leader based on work by Jim Collins John Maxwell, Peter Northouse, Melissa Perri, and more. One of the key findings is that a leader’s success is driven by their team, and how well that team aligns with the mission.

</ul>","<p>How can we ensure the continuous supply of the increasingly scarce raw materials that are needed to make the products we use every day? In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.</p>
<p>A good number of the materials found in everyday products are now referred to as ""critical"". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance.</p>
<p>Many metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.</p>
<p>Innovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Scarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.</p>
<p>This course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.</p>

</ul>","<p>Machine learning classification and regression techniques have potential uses in various engineering disciplines. These machine learning models allow you to make predictions for a category (classification) or for a number (regression) given sensor data, and can be used in, for example, predicting properties of objects (such as their weight or shape).</p>
<p>Using hands-on and interactive exercises you will get insight into:</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong> and its variants, such as supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.</p>
<p><strong>Regression</strong> techniques such as linear regression, K-nearest neighbor regression, how to deal with outliers and evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> techniques such as the histogram method, the nearest mean (or nearest medoid) method and the nearest neighbor classifier. We cover the classification setting and important concepts such as the Bayes classifier and the Bayes error, the optimal classifier in theory.</p>
<p><strong>Training models</strong> using (stochastic) gradient descent and its variants, we learn how to tune this optimizer, and how to use it to construct a logistic regression classification model.</p>
<p><strong>Overfitting</strong> means a classifier works well on a training set but not on unseen test data. We discuss how to build complex non-linear models, and we analyze how we can understand overfitting using the bias-variance decomposition and the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we discuss how to evaluate fairly and tune machine learning models and estimate how much data they need for an sufficient performance.</p>
<p><strong>Regularization</strong> methods can help to mitigate overfitting. We discuss two regularization techniques for estimating the linear regression coefficients: ridge regression and LASSO. The latter can also be used for variable selection.</p>
<p><strong>Classifier evaluation</strong> metrics such as the ROC curve and confusion matrix can give more insight into the performance of classifiers. We also discuss what constitutes a “good” accuracy; this is given by so-called dummy-classifiers which are naïve baselines.</p>
<p><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</strong> are more advanced classification models that can provide good performance even in high-dimensional spaces and with little data. We discuss their different variants such as the soft-margin SVM, the hard-margin SVM and the nonlinear kernel SVM.</p>
<p><strong>Decision Trees</strong> are simple models that can easily be understood by lay people. They are easy to use and visualize, and instead of a black box they can be easily understood as an interpretable white box model, making them suitable for various applications.</p>
<p>The lectures feature a unique combination of videos mixed with hands-on interaction with machine learning algorithms to stimulate a deeper understanding. In the exercises you apply the algorithms in Python using scikit-learn and in the final project you will further deepen your understanding of the various concepts by building and tuning a machine learning pipeline from start to finish.</p>",2.5,14

<p>Great leaders are just ordinary people with the right skills at the right time. To become a great leader, however, you have to know yourself well. This means acknowledging and embracing your strengths. It also means understanding and learning to manage your weaknesses. It’s tougher than that sounds. How do you know what your strengths and weaknesses are? What are your core personality attributes? How do you make decisions? What’s your decision-making style? How do you know? How do you know accurately?</p>
<p><em>This certificate offers an extraordinary opportunity to spend some quality time with yourself to assess your current level of soft skills, clearly define your core self, and build soft skills which are essential to professional, not to mention life, success.</em></p>
<p>Knowing what you can change and what you can’t is invaluable knowledge. Stop investing in trying to change the unchangeable -- your traits -- and learn to work with them. Stop trying to change others’ traits, too. Learn to work with your strengths, build new skills and perfect existing ones. Then do the same for your team. To start, you must have self-awareness.</p>
<p>Within self-awareness are several dimensions essential for effective leadership::</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional intelligence</li>
<li>personal values</li>
<li>cognitive style, how you think</li>
<li>orientation to change</li>
<li>core personality attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of core personality traits which are much less open to change, all other areas of self-awareness are open for development.</p>
<p>Verified learners can access the Power Lab to take self-assessments and receive confidential, benchmarked results. In this course, self-assessments include: core self-evaluation, core personality attributes, self-awareness, and cognitive style, how you make decisions.</p>
<p>From these assessments, verified learners can identify their current strengths and opportunities for growth. You can set goals for your own development with confidence. And, you will learn key practices for how to move from goal to action to strength.</p>
<p>Immediately useful takeaways from this course include enormous self-knowledge of your:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-awareness and how to improve it</li>
<li>core personality attributes and benefits</li>
<li>thinking styles and how to deploy them</li>

<p>""Databases"" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>
<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>
<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>
<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>
<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",3.3,19
Managing Conflicts on Projects with Cultural and Emotional Intelligence,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/c5fd6be8-1018-43cb-9034-ffe59b75a3d2-ed7f673918cc.jpeg,https://www.edx.org/learn/conflict-resolution/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-managing-conflicts-on-projects-with-cultural-and-emotional-intelligence,<p>Great program managers understand and heal bad communication habits and conflicts that arise within project teams and stakeholders. Learn how by leveraging emotional and cultural intelligence using the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM).</p>,"<ul>
<li>Social worlds in the context of programs and projects.</li>
<li>Cultural intelligence and the four steps.</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence and its five components.</li>
<li>How to utilize cultural intelligence and emotional intelligence concepts to increase the effectiveness of your program or project management communication.</li>
<li>How to utilize the CMM tools to diagnose and manage communication problems.</li>
</ul>","<p>Every program and project has a social world. The program managers, project managers, project teams, and stakeholders mutually agree on roles and interact based on those roles. </p>
<p>Great program managers sense, manage, and influence the social worlds across their projects. They bring order and understanding through conflict management and conflict resolution. Success is not guaranteed, and often teams clash as a new social order is established on every project. They heal divides that can grow under the stress of projects and increase the team’s problem solving ability. </p>
<p>Dr. Pearce, the inventor of the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM), explains the social world as a “dance between the two faces of the communication process: coordinating actions and making/managing meaning. A social world is the site where speech acts, episodes and forms of communication, selves and forms of consciousness, and relationships and minds are made.”</p>
<p>Our cultural differences and emotions significantly shape our social worlds. </p>
<p>The program and project manager with good emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence (EI/CI) can better understand and navigate the social worlds of the project team and the stakeholders. High EI/CI also aids in creating understanding in program/project management communications. A program manager or project manager with high EI/CI is more adept at creating understanding because they are self-aware while understanding other’s emotions.Thus, the program manager or project manager can test if the recipient of his or her communication has the requisite know-what, know-how, and know-why understanding of the intended messages.</p>
<p>Program managers and project managers with high EI/CI will be perceived as having a high ethos. Team members will see the high emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence even in the manager’s nonverbal communication. Being more aware of our feelings and other people’s feelings helps enhance our connection to others and make us more credible. Program managers and Project managers with high EI/CI can use pathos more effectively and make the logos portion of their communication more effective. The right balance of ethos, pathos, and logos makes the project manager more persuasive.</p>
<p>Along with increasing the program manager or project manager’s EI/CI, this course will aid the manager in using the tools of CMM. Dr. Pearce created Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) in the mid-1970s. Over the years, CMM practitioners have created methods and tools to make the communication perspective visible. One such tool is SEAVA, which is an acronym for Storyboarding, Enriching, Analyzing, Visioning, and Acting. You can use the SEAVA tool to examine communication problems among your project team members and to generate a solution.</p>
<p>Understanding the different social worlds of your program and its project team members and stakeholders will help you create persuasive communications, have a positive impact, and increase understanding among the project team members and stakeholders. CMM will help you become a master of communication and persuasion.</p>",3.2,8

<p>How to cultivate a broadened perspective on gender, identity, and power in the daily lives of all global citizens.</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p>Multiple experts from across faculties at The University of Hong Kong and professionals engaged in gender-related developments in Asia will address the ways in which gender is understood, constructed and performed. Drawing from a variety of perspectives – cultural studies, economics, education, law, linguistics, psychology, public health, politics, social policy, and sociology - we begin by questioning meanings of gender in different cultural settings and historical moments. What do the representations of our currently used categories such as man, woman, transgender, queer, cisgender, bisexual, or intersex mean in different contexts? How are conversations about gender taking place in Asia and how do they converge or diverge from those happening elsewhere? </p>
<p>The course is a comparative, interdisciplinary and cross-sector conversation which encourages reflective thinking about practices of gender. It courts and questions the fixity of language, traditions, laws, and practices as well as the resilience of stereotypes, biases, and structures which perpetuate myths, hierarchies and discrimination. </p>
<p>Unraveling the interlinkages between these conversations and categories equips you with the skills needed to identify, recognize and reject outmoded or biased constructions of gender as well as the power hierarchies these embed within social relations. We will examine why gender equity is so important and yet hard to achieve. We scrutinize social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects the gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding gender and its relations with society, we look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence. </p>
<p>Additionally, as digital technology plays an ever-increasing role in contemporary construction of social realities of people, the course looks into how, if at all, these networked communities offer new expressions of gender as performativity and the ways in which these replicate, reproduce or refashion traditional gender categories and roles. </p>
<p>Then we turn to challenge our everyday practices of gender and how they colour our approaches, assumptions, and biases (conscious and unconscious) about the ‘other’? The course invites scrutiny of the practice and performance of gendering self and others. At the same time, it is a reminder that gender is not just about identity but also about power. The course examines manifestations and causes of gender inequality and its inextricable link to structural and institutional forces of discrimination. To better understand the interaction between identity and power, we look at gender-based violence. The #metoo movement has exposed not only the depth and scale of violence but also unmasked the asymmetries of power. Power and privilege are enjoyed by a select group while the voices of others remain invisible and ignored. </p>
<p>We conclude by looking at local, national and global efforts to address gender disparities in society in various domains. We invite you to reflect on the course materials and to connect them to your daily life. How can your new understandings about gender generate a ripple of change around you?</p>",3.7,13

<p>We will review the primary project delivery method arrangements with their advantages and disadvantages, and cover the three major types of contracts. It is the owner’s requirement to analyze the project delivery method advantages and disadvantages. The best way to do this is to examine the project risks and major categories of project risk. </p>
<p>Next, we’ll address design. Good design is a result of collaboration among many different people, including the construction manager, architect, engineers, and owner. Although there is always a lead designer, the project is a combination of the collaborative process and consultation with other experts.</p>

<li>Finite automata and regular expressions</li>
<li>Context-free grammars</li>
<li>Turing machines and decidability</li>
<li>The theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems</li>
</ul>","<p>We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called ""regular languages."" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.</p>
<p>Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.</p>
<p>Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called ""recursively enumerable languages""). We shall learn how ""problems"" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be ""decidable"" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and ""undecidable"" if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.</p>
<p>Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.</p>",3.4,15

<p>We will address themes in your personal and professional life and show you how to counsel at all stages. We start with a positive approach by giving attention to people’s talents. We recognize that human existence involves constraints and difficulties, which is why this course is based on the idea of “existential” well-being.</p>
<p>This course will teach you how to live fully as a human being, in this body, on this planet, while at the same time being conscious that you are just a small part of a vast, incomprehensible, universe.</p>
<p>Our experiential approach focuses on the innate wisdom of the human organism and our tendency to evolve in a forward-moving direction. You will learn how to become aware of this deeply felt knowledge by giving attention to your body as felt from the inside and to your emotions.</p>
<p>Our person-centered approach encourages building optimal human relationships through empathy, respect and authenticity. These are complex skills, which we will bring within your reach by means of simple exercises.</p>
<p>Through examples, role-play and video-demonstrations we will illustrate how you can apply our existential well-being approach in a variety of helping contexts, including counseling and psychotherapy. You will develop skills to embody the existential well-being approach as a person and as a professional.</p>
<p>Your learning will be enriched through exchanging thoughts and experiences with a diverse group of international participants. You will learn to notice how people from different cultures have different ideas about what it means to live well and meaningfully. You will engage in discussions where divergent values can be respectfully acknowledged. Your personal view of well-being will expand and deepen to a more universal perspective on what it means to be human.</p>
<p>This course is taught by instructors with decades of experience in existential psychotherapy, focusing -oriented and emotion-focused therapy, person-centered counseling and positive psychology.</p>

</ul>","<p>The industrial advancement of mankind is inextricably linked with natural resources. We cannot underestimate our collective reliance on minerals and mineral products, not only for industrial and commercial progress, but also in the health and agriculture industries. Mined ore, as well as the commensurate beneficiation, processing and refining of the product, provides the industrial sector with the required material to further shape and fabricate this material into the end product to be used for the benefit of mankind.</p>
<p>In this course we will look at how minerals extraction or production only occurs after discovery, exploration, research, analysis and planning have all been completed. Planning requires a firm knowledge of a commodity’s future market in terms of supply and demand, its value or forecast price, the capital outlay (development costs) and the costs to produce it and, critically, how the development of that deposit will be funded. This funding may take the form of equity, debt or potentially derivative or convertible instruments or through other innovative funding mechanisms such as metal streaming, farm-ins and participation funding (joint ventures).</p>
<p>We will also look at the number of people either directly or indirectly linked to the mining business, with the multitude of stakeholders ranging from employees, service providers, financiers and investors through to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and activists.</p>
<p>Throughout the course we reference the <span lang=""EN-AU"">value-chain which represents the stages and processes that a minerals project will go through to produce mineral products.

</ul>","<p>This Data Structures &amp; Algorithms course completes the 4-course sequence of the program with graph algorithms, dynamic programming and pattern matching solutions. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear and non-linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>You will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. Understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. Once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. Dijkstra’s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. You will investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST: Prim’s and Kruskal’s.</p>
<p>Prim’s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. Kruskal’s approaches the MST differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest.</p>
<p>The other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. Pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. You begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. However, KMP does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. Rabin-Karp uses hash codes and a “rolling hash” to find the pattern in the text. A different text processing problem is locating DNA subsequences which leads us directly to Dynamic Programming techniques. You will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.</p>",3.9,17

</li>
</ul>","<p>The user experience is defined as the result of the internal states (eg expectations, predispositions) of a user, the characteristics of a system (eg complexity, usability) and the context of use of the interaction between the user and the system (eg in organization, in private).</p>
<p>Organizations value innovative and well-designed user experiences for their customers and employees, whether they are using their websites, mobile applications, self-service kiosks in store, or various internal interfaces. The practice of UX design uses the user-centered approach and covers 3 main activities: UX research (getting to know the users and their contexts), activities surrounding ideation (such as ""design thinking"" and participatory design) and prototyping. This course teaches methods, techniques and digital tools specific to UX in today's business context.</p>
<p>A UX professional is able to intervene in the design process of a digital product or service in order to ensure a user-centered approach. This allows the organization to respond to the expectations of its users. A UX professional mobilizes a range of interview and observation methodologies until the development of a prototyped interface.</p>
<p>UXPA defines user experience professionals as specialists involved in research, design and evaluation of products and services. Conceptually, this notion of user experience emerges from the human-centered design approach in the field of human machine interaction and human factors in industrial engineering.</p>
<p>Research corresponds to the activity of learning about user interfaces and the context in which they will be used.</p>
<p>Evaluation corresponds to user observation when using these interfaces, as much before, during and after the design and development of the product.</p>
<p>Design corresponds to the standards and principles of design of digital products or services offering optimal user experiences.</p>

Semantics of First-Order Logic,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/7e8601c6-c50a-4345-8af9-de4b0072b15c-7856be03d2d1.png,https://www.edx.org/learn/logic/stanford-university-semantics-of-first-order-logic,"<p>First-order logic is a restricted, formalized language which is particularly suited to the precise expression of ideas. The language has uses in many disciplines including computer science, mathematics, linguistics and artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>We will describe how to write sentences in the language, how to determine when a sentence is true in a particular situation, how to recognize important relationships between sentences, and describe some limitations of the language.</p>","<p>This class is an introduction to one of the basic tools used in the study of logic, a tool that is applied in a range of disciplines from computer science and math to linguistics and philosophy.</p>
<p>The course is divided into two halves. In the first we study a fragment of first-order logic called <em>propositional logic</em>. This language allows us to get our feet wet with the basic ideas of the course. These ideas include the specification of formal grammar rules for determining when an expression is <em>well-formed</em>. Well-formed expressions may make claims about the world, that is they may be considered <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. You will learn how to determine whether a sentence is true in a particular situation. With the basic ideas in hand, you will then learn how to recognize relationships between sentences, the most important of which is <em>consequence</em>. One sentence is a consequence of another, or follows from another, if it is true whenever the other is.</p>
<p>At the end of the section on propositional logic, we will demonstrate that its expressiveness is limited, and that any attempt to increase the expressiveness of the language requires fundamentally new expressive devices.</p>
<p>In the second half of the course we expand the language of propositional language to the full language of first-order logic, providing the new semantic theory. Everything that you learned about propositional logic holds in the larger language, but new expressive abilities are added to the language. We again investigate concepts of grammaticality, truth and consequence for the larger language. We will see that as a consequence of increasing the expressiveness of the language, the required extension to the semantic theory is more complicated than the theory of propositional logic.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are still sentences of English that are not expressible in first-order logic. We will conclude by describing these limitations, setting the stage for further learning in the field of logic.</p>","<p>The focus of this class is on the <em>language of first-order logic</em> , a formally defined language that allows us to make precise and unambiguous statements about any subject of interest.</p>
<p>Using the language of first-order logic we will investigate many foundational topics in logic. We will address such questions as what counts as a grammatical expression, and the circumstances under which it makes a claim about the world (whether it can be considered true or false, E.g. “the sky is brown”, as compared to “oh, my goodness!”).</p>
<p>For expressions that do make claims — we call these <em>sentences</em> — we can further examine whether they are true or false in particular situations. “Aristotle is alive” is a sentence that was once true, but became false around 2000 years ago, and has remained false ever since.</p>
<p>These questions fall into the study of <em>semantics</em> , or meaning.</p>
<p>Once we understand how sentences can be considered true or false, we can investigate important related questions. Some sentences are always true, that is true in every situation — we call such sentences <em>logical truths</em>. Sentences bear relationships with one another. For example, two sentences might be true in exactly the same situations - they are <em>logically equivalent.</em> We will demonstrate methods for determining when these properties and relationships hold as natural extensions to the semantic theory for first-order logic.</p>
<p>Finally, we will explore the limits of first-order logic. There are some sentences of English that are not expressible in the language, and it is important to know that this is the case, and to understand why it is so. This observation has led logicians to develop yet more powerful languages with more complex semantics. Almost all of these languages are based on the language of first-order logic and knowledge of first-order logic is fundamental to understanding them. So first-order logic is a basic building block for the study of these language and is a great place to begin the journey into the field of logic.</p>",3.3,17
Linear Algebra II: Matrix Algebra,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/61edae95-3737-485f-b7e8-bb84d2f3ecbe-cbc25e81aec7.jpeg,https://www.edx.org/learn/linear-algebra/the-georgia-institute-of-technology-linear-algebra-ii-matrix-algebra,"<p>This course takes you through roughly three weeks of MATH 1554, Linear Algebra, as taught in the School of Mathematics at The Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>","<p>Upon completion of this course, learners will be able to:</p>

<li>Apply the formal definition of an inverse, and its algebraic properties, to solve and analyze linear systems.</li>
<li>Characterize the invertibility of a matrix using the Invertible Matrix Theorem.</li>
<li>Apply partitioned matrices to solve problems regarding matrix invertibility and matrix multiplication.</li>

<li>Characterize a matrix using the concepts of rank, column space, and null space.</li>
<li>Apply the Rank, Basis, and Matrix Invertibility theorems to describe matrices, subspaces, and systems.</li>
</ul>","<p>Your ability to apply the concepts that we introduced in our previous course is enhanced when you can perform algebraic operations with matrices. At the start of this class, you will see how we can apply the Invertible Matrix Theorem to describe how a square matrix might be used to solve linear equations. This theorem is a fundamental role in linear algebra, as it synthesizes many of the concepts introduced in the first course into one succinct concept. </p>
<p>You will then explore theorems and algorithms that will allow you to apply linear algebra in ways that involve two or more matrices. You will examine partitioned matrices and matrix factorizations, which appear in most modern uses of linear algebra. You will also explore two applications of matrix algebra, to economics and to computer graphics. </p>

The Science of Parenting,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/a379c18c-92a8-4ff7-b271-33398cccbfcf-2932a573e184.jpg,https://www.edx.org/learn/parenting/the-university-of-california-san-diego-the-science-of-parenting,"<p>Move beyond the chatterand opinion surrounding parenting and learn about thescientific findings and data that can help you make sensible, informed parenting decisions.</p>","<ul>
<li><strong>Core knowledge</strong> on topics including infant sleep, forms of discipline, breastfeeding, language and math learning, screen time, bilingualism, and autism.</li>
<li><strong>Analytical and applied techniques</strong> , including how to compute the contribution of genetics to a trait, how to understand and compute correlations, and how kids can effectively study for tests.</li>
<li><strong>Best practices</strong> for sleep training, discipline, and feeding.</li>
</ul>","<p>Everyone has an opinion on parenting – where babies should sleep, what they should eat, and whether parents should spank, scold, or praise. What’s more, the media often offers support for whichever opinions appear most popular at any given time. This leavesthose of us who like to base our decisions on firm, provablefacts feeling dizzy.  </p>
<p>“The Science of Parenting” addresses this confusion by moving beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting, and by <strong>looking directly at the science</strong>. Parenting itself is far from a science. Nevertheless, scientists have conducted thousands of studies that can help parents – or future parents – make sensible, informed decisions.   </p>
<p>One goal of this coursewill be to provide a <strong>survey of important scientific findings</strong> spanning a range of topics that are central to the lives of parents:  </p>
<ul>
<li>diet</li>
<li>sleep</li>
<li>discipline</li>
<li>learning</li>
<li>screen time</li>
<li>impulse control</li>
<li>vaccination</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also <strong>explore ongoing mysteries</strong> , like what causes autism, and why so many children are allergic to peanuts.  </p>
<p>Perhaps more important, this coursewill not only dig into existing science, but will also <strong>explore the underlying nature of parenting science itself</strong>. Often, scientists measure correlations: They ask how different parenting practices are related to different behaviors in children. But the claims they make from 'correlational data are often much, much stronger. For example, from correlational data, scientists often claim that parents cause the behaviors of their kids. This coursewill show how this type of error – common in the scientific literature – can <strong>explain a significant amount of the confusion present in the media</strong> and general public. Wewill discuss how to avoid the same error when evaluating science, and how to use the sum of available evidence to inform decision making.  </p>
<p>The course’s instructor, David Barner, is a leading authority on cognitive development. He is joined by leading experts on behavior genetics, vaccination, autism, lying, and spanking, as well as by real live parents who try to use science to inform their decisions. This class is suitable not only for parents, future parents, and grandparents, but also for <strong>professionals interested in health care, social work, and early childhood education</strong> who want to increase their knowledge and analysis skills.</p>",1.0,18

</ul>","<p>In September 2015, 193 member states of the United Nations adopted the<a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld""> 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> and committed themselves to the 17 <a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth.</p>
<p>Goal 1, “End poverty in all its forms everywhere,” calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10, “Reduce inequality within and among countries,” calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world.</p>
<p>This course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world. It will examine links between poverty, inequality, and well-being; opportunities for socioeconomic mobility; the particular challenges facing women, minorities, Indigenous people, and vulnerable populations; and how poverty and inequality link to issues like climate change, migration, and conflict. Finally, the course will conclude with a look at policy approaches and tools for addressing poverty and inequality in a variety of contexts.</p>

<p>● How to build a project risk management plan </p>
<p>● How to develop a risk register and framework for project risk </p>
<p>● How to use expert judgement to assign risk impacts and likelihoods to prioritize and address project risk </p>
<p>● How to adjust for our understanding of risk over time</p>
<p>● How to think about project risk response strategies</p>","<p>Project risk management involves identifying, assessing, quantifying, modeling, and managing risks that may face a project. Complex projects face the challenge of accurately estimating costs and completion times, or even of failing to deliver outcomes as planned. Even the simplest projects always have some element of risk.</p>
<p>Ways are needed to identify and manage risks to prevent project failure. A risk plan is the way to lessen the chance of adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>The project risk management plan is the fundamental instrument for identifying elements and activities of project risk management, establishing risk breakdown structures, quantifying the extent of risk, and planning a mitigation strategy.</p>
<p>The initial step in planning for project risk management is developing the risk register. A risk register is a detailed inventory of things that could go wrong. The risk register provides a plan to follow the project through completion.</p>
<p>Assigning probabilities and consequences to the many items in the risk register is in itself challenging. Contemporary lessons from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics provide insights into how to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, the project manager must consider the best responses to risk including how to avoid, mitigate, plan contingencies, or transfer the risk. There are many ways to re-organize the project and ownership of risk, as well as adjust how the project objective is achieved.</p>",1.5,12

<p>Module 1</p>
<p>Know basic greetings and essential daily expressions</p>
<p>Know the phonological structures of Cantonese</p>
<p>Know basic Jyutping, including initials, finals and tones</p>
<p>Module 2</p>
<p>Know some Cantonese food’s names (when eating in a Chinese restaurant)</p>

<p>Know the name of some cities and countries</p>","<p>Here describes some characteristics of our course:</p>
<p>- Although there are various free online Cantonese learning resources and videos available, most of them are loosely organized and not as systematic as a university credit bearing course. The proposed MOOC will be designed in a way that help learners acquire the language step by step, following the scientific findings of second language acquisition.</p>
<p>- The comparable existing certificate programmes or credit-bearing courses such as those offered by the Chinese Language Centre of The University of Hong Kong and the Yale-China Chinese Language Centre of The Chinese University of Hong Kong as well as by the overseas universities mentioned above are delivered in the traditional mode, which are bound by various practical limitations. Therefore, the proposed MOOC, which goes beyond time constraints and geographical barriers, will be the first ever delivered on such a platform, attracting global learners.</p>
<p>- Cantonese, unlike many other languages/dialects, cannot be written verbatim, nor does it have an officially recognized romanization convention. This makes Cantonese learning difficult. The proposed MOOC will use the Jyutping system to teach Cantonese. Jyutping was proposed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong, and is one of the two commonly used conventions for Cantonese romanization in academic publications.</p>
<p>- As a MOOC from Hong Kong, some aspects of the Hong Kong culture (especially food) will be introduced.</p>

Beyond the words on a page, physical texts provide insights into the history, culture, and people of a time. One such text is the Jewish Bible, which has a physical history as storied and diasporic as that of the Jewish people.</p>","<ul>
<li>The importance of the Jewish Bible as a physical object</li>
<li>What the Jewish Book meant and still means for the Jewish people, from the earliest rendering to the most complex layouts of Jewish Study Bible pages</li>
<li>How the shape, script, and layout represent the cultural, political, intellectual, and religious changes of the Jewish community in the context of the non-Jewish cultures </li>
<li>How to read and interpret the context and meaning of the pages, from the earliest forms of Codex through the digital age</li>
<li>The differences in the books that make up the Jewish Bible, and the page formats of the codex throughout history, encouraging your own reading and comparison between instances</li>
<li>How to appreciate ancient texts, using the Bible as a physical object, through touch, smell, and written word—enhancing your appreciation for ancient wisdom, rituals, and Rabbinic law</li>
</ul>","<p>When studying the Jewish Bible and other historical works, the physical attributes—the form of the writing, whether it be scroll, codex, or simply a printed page layout, in addition to the size and shape—determine how we read the book and understand its meaning. Whether you are interested in literature or history, ancient or religious art and texts, or looking to deepen your understanding of religion and its impact on the world, this course will delve deeper into the Jewish Book as a physical object and spark desire to learn more about the materials as both artifact and religious content—enriching your understanding of the Jewish Bible, how it came to be, and its place today in a digital age.</p>
<p>In The Jewish Bible: Its History as a Physical Artifact, you will focus largely on the Torah Scroll—elaborate, handwritten scrolls that share the first five books of Moses, the first books of the Jewish Bible. The physical Torah has been a revered part of the Jewish community for centuries; there is even a tradition of touching the Torah as it is brought around the congregation as a sign of respect and paying homage to its history. In this course you will learn about the birth of the scrolls; their evolution from scrolls to codex; and the Jewish Bible through culture, history, and religion.</p>
<p>By exploring the ancient Hebrew Bibles that Jews have held in their hands, chanted in the synagogue, and studied in school and at home, you will be immersed in the history of the book as an artifact of other religions, and how Jews transformed the Bible over centuries using cultural and religious context. As you study the Bible as a physical book, you will learn how the materiality of the Jewish Book serves as an interface between the Hebrew text, history, and the modern world.</p>",2.8,20

</ul>","<p>Los dispositivos tecnológicos y el uso de herramientas digitales están llegando a niveles de democratización cada vez más altos. Algunas de las razones las podemos encontrar en que las herramientas digitales se vuelven diariamente más amigables con los usuarios; surgen con más frecuencia aplicaciones conectadas a diferentes dimensiones de la vida humana; familiares, escolares, empresariales, etc.</p>
<p>La transformación digital es un tema vigente en los negocios del siglo XXI. El enfoque comercial de muchas aplicaciones digitales está cobrando mucha relevancia a la hora de entender los negocios. La manera en cómo se hace la comercialización de productos está pasando de un entorno tradicional y físico de largo plazo, hacia un contexto más orientado a las plataformas digitales y de corto plazo impulsadas por gigantes de la tecnología, como Amazon, Shopify o Apple que cuentan con ecommerce website u online store.</p>
<p>Incluso, muchas de las estrategias tradicionales de comunicación de productos están siendo reemplazadas por entornos digitales, como las alianzas con influencers, promoción en podcast, redes sociales, etc. Existen también herramientas que ayudan a colocar a tu producto en la mira de tu target audience, mediante prácticas de mejoramiento del SEO de las páginas web y uso de social media para la promoción de productos.</p>
<p>Todos estos cambios han afectado la manera como los negocios entienden la comercialización de sus productos. La tendencia comercial y el estilo de vida de las sociedades digitales obliga a los negocios y las organizaciones a replantearse su brand strategy y así impactar en su brand identity para que se identifique con el buyer persona deseado. Muchas empresas en América Latina están siguiendo estas nuevas estrategias y el impacto en sus ventas llama mucho la atención.</p>
<p>Tan solo en América Latina, el esquema de venta online ha ido creciendo fuertemente, incluso antes de la pandemia. Según los datos del Statista Digital Market Outlook del 2019, Brasil y México fueron líderes en ventas online llegando a facturar, $17,000 millones y $14,000 millones de dólares, respectivamente.</p>
<p>También otras economías experimentan un crecimiento acelerado en ventas online, tal es el caso de Argentina y Perú, de los cuales se prevé que entre 2019 y 2024 crezcan un 153% y 121%, respectivamente.</p>
<p>Estas cifras se relacionan con otros estudios en los cuales señalan el crecimiento de conectividad que tienen las personas al internet.</p>
<p>Según el reporte Digital 2019, tan solo en México el número de usuarios de internet llegó a 80.6 millones, lo que representa, según el INEGI, el 70.1% de la población total.</p>
<p>Las personas están cada vez más conectadas a internet y, por tanto, la tendencia del número de ventas online se espera que crezca aceleradamente.</p>
<p>Por estas razones, las empresas deben apostar en invertir para abrir sus canales de posicionamiento de marca, automatizar su marketing digital, mejorar el customer experience, identificar su público objetivo y en desarrollar aplicaciones y herramientas de inteligencia artificial que les permita gestionar tareas repetitivas y encontrar datos y patrones para mejorar sus procesos y la experiencia del cliente.</p>

Persuasion and Presence for Program and Project Managers,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/15ef4d57-0f2b-4484-946f-8c9a42aaef32-c72747687f13.jpeg,https://www.edx.org/learn/management/the-university-of-maryland-college-park-persuasion-and-presence-for-program-and-project-managers,<p>Logic is not enough. Program managers need presence and to move stakeholders emotionally. Project professionals only follow people they both respect and trust. Learn to apply Aristotle’s persuasion triad to create successful communication that persuades.</p>,"<ul>
<li>Explain the rhetorical triad and its use in persuasion.</li>
<li>Establish a compelling and trustworthy presence (ethos).</li>
<li>Create spoken and written messages with emotional impact to build understanding.</li>
<li>Develop psychological safety within your project team and with stakeholders.</li>
</ul>","<p>Persuasion is the central to leading leaders. As a program manager or project manager, you may lead a team with many senior contributors. Often they will have more experience, more skin in the game, and more reputation at stake. As a program manager, this task is even greater because your time is limited and your span of control across projects even greater. Being a compelling communicator takes more than what you learned for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam or Project Management Professional (PMP) exam. It takes program or project management experience and this certificate program.</p>
<p>Program managers must persuade quickly, and with great lasting impact. Program and project managers must persuade and manage their leadership presence for program or project success. Even if you are a traditional program or project manager or manage agile programs or projects, persuasive communication is vital to your success. Communicating more persuasively will lead to more effective risk management.</p>
<p>There are complete blindsports in the Project Management Institute, Inc's (PMI)""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge"" (PMBOK Guide). Applying those processes and skills are just the basics of efficient communication.</p>
<p>That’s why certified project managers will earn 10 professional development units (PDU) in this program. You will learn the balance needed to communicate effectively. </p>
<p>Aristotle first wrote about balancing logic, emotion, and presence over 2,000 years ago. Creating a balance between ethos, pathos, and logos, the persuader creates a message that grabs the attention of the audience and engages them as people. A person doesn’t understand when they are not paying attention, is not engaged with the speaker, and doesn’t remember what was said. Ethos, pathos, and logos aid the speaker and the listener, by helping to select information to present and how to fashion its delivery for the best effect.</p>
<p>In this program management and project management training course, you will go beyond the communication skills you learned for the PMP exam to gain your project management certification. You will learn about the rhetorical triangle and how to use it to craft persuasive communications. Social media and online collaboration tools require new ways of establishing your presence and generating trust between you and your audience. You will also learn how to create an emotional impact even through text messages and emails.</p>",3.6,15

The goal of the course is not to cover everything that has been written on Othello. Rather, it is to find a single point of entry to help us think about the play as a whole. Our entry point is storytelling. </p>
<p>We'll look at the ways in which Shakespeare's characters tell stories within the play––about themselves, to themselves, and to each other. We'll consider, too, how actors, directors, composers, and other artists tell stories through Othello in performance. By focusing on storytelling, we can see how the play grapples with larger issues including power, identity, and the boundary between fact and fiction. </p>

While it is easy to identify major stressors such as change of job, relocation or stringent timelines but identifying the sources of chronic stress may be more complicated. It is also very important to understand how one’s own thoughts, feelings, and behaviours contribute to one’s everyday stress levels apart from the external events or situations. </p>
<p>For an individual, it is difficult to avoid, for a prolonged period, threatening external event or situation which engenders a feeling of anxiety, tension and worry i.e., stress. </p>
<p>This gives rise to some obvious questions like ‘How does one get into stressful condition?’, ‘Why do I feel drained out?’, ‘Is it good to take extra load for growth?’, ‘Does time-management help managing stress?’, ‘Is managing stress in my hands?’ ‘How as an individual should I approach and manage my stress and lead a controlled life?’.</p>

<li>Distinguish common methods (e.g., interviewing, focus groups) and analytical techniques (qualitative data analysis) used within and across core qualitative traditions.</li>
<li>Begin thinking about your own qualitative study of a topic in psychology.</li>
</ul>","<p>In our daily lives, many of us ask questions of ourselves and about others. Some of these questions, born of simple curiosity, resemble elements of qualitative research. For instance, what will I wear today—and what motives, both overt and hidden to the world, will guide those choices? Or, why does my neighbor seem particularly downtrodden today when he’s normally happy? Or, for what reasons is my favorite charitable organization having difficulty recruiting new members this year, especially when the factors surrounding recruitment haven’t changed? These, and other questions, may arise from our observations and our experiences of the world in which we live. As you will learn in this course, these questions become qualitative research projects when the right methods and analytical processes are learned and applied.</p>
<p>Through qualitative research, we are able to explore—through methods like interviews and observations—various facets of individuals’ lived experiences. Qualitative research in psychology arises from historical and cross-disciplinary foundations, as well as from dynamic philosophical underpinnings. We will focus on the past and present of qualitative inquiry, with grounding in contemporary examples across a variety of psychology fields. Through tools, illustrations, and self-assessments, you will learn some of the basics of qualitative research while examining your own research predilections and experiences. We hope you will emerge with an understanding of, and appreciation for, how qualitative inquiry adds depth, character, and nuance to our understanding of humans’ individual and collective experiences.</p>
<p>Qualitative research usually involves naturalistic inquiry. This means that we explore human experiences of the real world as they’re living it, or as it was lived. Qualitative inquiry invites inquiry into everyday living experiences. Through an array of qualitative traditions and their associated methods, we can investigate beliefs, biases, behaviors, routines, roles, cultures, and other facets of the human experience. Here, you will learn about the foundations of qualitative inquiry—and how it differs from quantitative research, yet in complementary ways. Relatedly, you will gain practice in common qualitative traditions—like phenomenology and ethnography—and some of the methods they use, such as interviewing. We hope you will gain the competence, confidence, and “know-how” to begin planning your own qualitative study of a topic in psychology.</p>",1.1,15

<li>Analyze the stability, memory usage and adaptations of all sorting algorithms presented</li>
<li>Study the time complexity for the AVLs, (2-4) Trees and sorting algorithms</li>
</ul>","<p>This Data Structures &amp; Algorithms course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing AVL and (2-4) trees. It also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming, and linear and nonlinear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>You will investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: AVL and (2-4) trees. Both of these data structures focus on self-balancing techniques that will ensure all operations are O(log n). AVL trees are a subgroup of BSTs and thus inherit all the properties and constraints from BSTs. Additionally, AVLs incorporate rotations that are triggered when the tree is mutated and becomes out of balance. (2-4) trees are a subgroup of B-Trees and are non-binary trees with more than 2 children. 2-4 defines the range of children that exists in the trees. However, these trees are extremely flexible and allow the nodes to shrink and grow as needed to store more data. With this flexibility comes more issues to handle, like overflow and underflow which require more intense techniques to resolve the issues.</p>
<p>As you enter the algorithm portion of the course, you begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. There are optimizations that can be included in the standard Bubble sort to make it more adaptive in sorting. There is also a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. Divide &amp; Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity.</p>
<p>The course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade. Lastly, you'll complete a course exam, which counts for the remaining 30% of your grade.</p>",1.0,19

Many times when we think about statistics in our daily lives, we think about numerical expressions of statistics, such as the number of daily COVID cases in our county, the percentage of students admitted each year to our university, or the number of people that voted in the last election. From each of these examples, we could go on to make inferences or look to answer questions based on this data, such as whether to open restaurants, how many new students are psychology majors, or if a specific issue drove voters to the polls in a specific state.</p>
<p>This course will begin by introducing the basic concepts of how to describe and visualize data, the fundamentals of using statistics to make inferences, and the logic of null hypothesis testing. Various types of hypothesis tests will be introduced, along with criteria for selecting which is appropriate for different study conditions. As an extension of null hypothesis significance tests, you will learn about how to interpret effect sizes and confidence intervals, along with statistical power, before being introduced to alternatives to null hypothesis significance testing.

<p>En confrontant l'analyse théorique à des situations pratiques, vous constaterez que, correctement interprétée, la convention de Genève demeure efficace et impose, aujourd'hui encore, de protéger comme réfugiés ( <em>refugees</em> ) de nombreux fugitifs ( <em>Fl uchtlingen</em> ).</p>
<p>Vous suivrez aussi le parcours du réfugié - comme ce labyrinthe que représente également l'image que vous voyez ci-dessus - pour mesurer la nécessité d'une bonne connaissance du droit dans les procédures.</p>
<p>Au-delà du droit, vous verrez aussi l'importance d'une approche interdisciplinaire, notamment pour mesurer la crédibilité du récit d'un requérant d'asile.</p>
<p>Vous verrez l'importance des protections régionales, subsidiaires ou complémentaires et approfondirez la situation spécifique de la protection en Afrique.</p>
<p>Vous vous interrogerez encore sur les défis futurs, comme la question des réfugiés climatiques.</p>
<p>Avec ce cours <em>Droit d'asile et des réfugiés</em> , vous saurez si un migrant peut ou non être refoulé vers un autre pays, s'il doit être inclus dans la définition du réfugié ou en être exclu, s'il faut contester une décision relative au statut de réfugié. Tout cela, vous le ferez en développant un raisonnement juridique rigoureux.</p>",3.4,12

<p>The Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Agenda 2030 outline a global consensus on the interlinked needs to curb human-induced climate change and achieve sustainable development. The underlying transformations needed to achieve climate goals and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include the rapid decarbonization of our global energy systems and economies, and a scale-up of new technologies to meet the needs of a growing population. Mining and materials are at the heart of these sustainable development transformations and present both challenges and opportunities. Despite the important implications for mining investments and mineral-rich governments, the world still lacks a coherent vision to guide global actors in shifting the course of mining projects and mining companies in a way that leads to deep decarbonization; protects and preserves our fragile ecosystems; addresses the development needs of resource-dependent, low-income countries; and respects the rights and interests of impacted communities.</p>

These qualities are aspects of a drug’s pharmacokinetics or PK. Pharmacokinetics encompasses how a drug is absorbed and flows through a patient until it is ultimately eliminated. While pharmacokinetics covers drug behavior in a living organism, PK properties can often be predicted through laboratory tests for a compound’s ADME properties. ADME stands for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The PK and ADME properties of potential drug are closely monitored throughout the discovery and early development stages of a drug campaign.</p>","<ul>

<p>How is intangible cultural heritage – or ‘living heritage’ – related to sustainable development? How is it relevant for addressing today’s development challenges in areas such as health, education, gender, natural disasters and conflict? Why is it important to keep this heritage alive? Communities around the world are transmitting their living heritage, which gives meaning to their lives, strengthens resilience, and contributes to their well-being. In this way intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development are closely linked. The international community made a commitment to safeguarding living heritage when it adopted the <a href=""https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000132540"">Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> in 2003 and it set itself ambitious goals by adopting the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>.

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Corey stumbled into Dr. Friedlander's Exercise Physiology class early in his college career. Eventually becoming her teaching assistant, the two joined forces to discover new and exciting ways to teach physiology to Stanford students. Together they decided that the best way for Corey to really understand the material was to experience a series of diverse physiologic stressors first hand. What resulted was a series of wild and crazy adventures captured on video that provide a novel approach to teaching you the fundamentals of environmental physiology. From cold tanks to aging suits to flying fighter planes and climbing mountains, Corey and Anne bring the science to life. Come join us and be a part of our story as we learn about the human body!</p>

<li>Situate the play in a long history of artistic representations of Jews in the West, with attention to the problem of anti-Semitism</li>
<li>Learn how the play, called a “comedy,” incorporates tragic elements that may prompt audiences to identify with Shylock despite his outsider status</li>
<li>Weigh different responses to Shylock over four centuries through the study of artifacts and interviews with authors, actors, and curators</li>
</ul>","<p>In the first act of William Shakespeare’s <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> , the Jewish moneylender Shylock proposes a “merry sport” to the merchant Antonio: he will lend Antonio the money he needs if Antonio agrees to let Shylock take a pound of his flesh should he default. Shylock calls this contract a “merry bond,” and Shakespeare’s First Folio calls the play a comedy. But what does Shylock want from the bond, and how merry does the play ultimately prove?</p>
<p>In this course, Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt guides learners through an in-depth exploration of the character of Shylock. You'll learn about Jewish history in Europe, how early audiences might have responded to the play, and the history of the play’s production through the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>With short video lectures, readings from the play, and explorations of adaptations, you will develop critical tools with which to unlock the play's possible meanings.</p>

</ul>","<p>What do collapsed buildings, infected hospital patients, and crashed airplanes have in common? If you know the causes of these events and conditions, they can all be prevented.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn how to use the TU Delft mind-set to investigate the causes of such events so you can prevent them in the future.</p>
<p>When, for instance, hundreds of hospital patients worldwide got infected after having gall bladder treatments, forensic engineering helped reveal how the design and use of the medical instruments could cause such widespread infections. As a result, changes were made to the instrument design and the procedural protocols in hospitals. Learning from failure in this case benefitted patient health and safety across the world.</p>
<p>After taking this course you will have an understanding of failures and the investigation processes used to find their causes. You will learn how to apply lessons gained from investigating previous failures into new designs and procedures.</p>
<p>The TU Delft Forensic Engineering mind-set involves recommendations for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection ranging from desk studies (theoretical/predicted performance of structures) to field investigations (actual performance of failed structures)</li>
<li>Hypothesis generation techniques for technical and procedural causes of failure</li>
<li>Hypothesis testing for engineering aspects of forensic cases</li>
<li>Reporting findings about the most likely causes and consequences</li>
<li>Improving engineering designs based on lessons learned from forensic cases</li>
</ul>
<p>The course uses case studies from Building Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Biomechanical Engineering. All of these provide great examples that illustrate the approaches and highlight technical and procedural causes of failure. You'll find that not only is it crucial, but it's also exciting to learn from failures.</p>

<p>While health is one of several factors influencing diets, it is a powerful one, especially in certain life situations such as illness and the birth of a child. <span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>Doctors enjoy special authority when speaking on matters of health and could play a key role in informing and persuading people to change their eating habits – during consultations but also through other channels. The global obesity epidemic, the rise of personalized medicine and increased understanding of the microbiome are also likely to converge into a situation where doctors can prescribe food as medicine, giving them influence over the decision, implementation, and confirmation stages as well. <span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>Currently, a key obstacle to medical professionals playing a stronger role in food systems transformation is their relative lack of training in nutrition, let alone sustainability. On the other hand, linking personal health to the health of the planet will for some people be an increased motivator to rethink diets. If medical doctors had better knowledge of the link between food, health, nutrition, and sustainability, they could play an active role in transforming our food system. </p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">Solution</span> </strong><span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>To overcome this gap in knowledge and to reinforce behaviour change towards healthier and sustainable diets, EIT Food has developed a <strong>short online course</strong> on nutrition targeting <strong>medical students</strong>. In addition, professionals in the medical sector may find this course useful for providing an up-to-date analysis of topical nutrition debates.<span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>The course title is “ <strong>Nutrition for Health and Sustainability</strong> ”. It is composed of 12 hours of learning broken down in 3 modules.<span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>On this course, students will look at what makes up a healthy diet and see what types of foods play a crucial part in preventing diseases. Learners will have the opportunity to build an understanding of the relationship between food and disease and get accustomed to nutrition counselling techniques. They’ll also reflect on the possible biological, social, and psychological causes of unhealthy eating patterns, and interpret the importance of evidence-based nutrition both for human and planet health.</p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">Ambition</span> </strong><span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>
<p>Our mission is to empower the future and current generation of medical doctor. We’ll equip them with fundamentals nutrition knowledge and nutrition counselling skills so that they could become the agents of change our society need.<span lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>

</ul>","<p>In this course, we begin with approaches to visualization of genome-scale data, and provide tools to build interactive graphical interfaces to speed discovery and interpretation. Using knitr and rmarkdown as basic authoring tools, the concept of reproducible research is developed, and the concept of an executable document is presented. In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as ""back ends"" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.</p>
<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses.

As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca – a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue – is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.</p>

<p>In the second part (modules 8–10), you will learn and discuss how macroeconomic policies can be used to address poor performance and reduce macroeconomic imbalances. We will illustrate the workings of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies by using a simple Keynesian model of an open economy. In the final module you will design an IMF–supported lending program scenario for our country case.</p>

The causes of decreasing customer satisfaction and increasing quality costs are often unknown, so derived solutions often only address symptoms. Six Sigma methods and tools enable a systematic solution of typical process problems and lead to sustainable operational excellence.</p>
<p>Go from Yellow to Green Belt in this project-based Lean Six Sigma course. With the TUM Yellow Belt, you have mastered the body of knowledge of our Green Belt (according to the American Society for Quality standards). Our Green Belt certification requires the implementation of a Six Sigma project (as recommended by the International Society of Six Sigma Professionals), just as the driving experience is necessary to obtain a driver’s license.</p>
<p>To earn the TUM Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification, you will implement a predefined standard project on environmental littering. The goal: “Improve the cleanliness of areas around selected places in your hometown and control the sustainability of your measures.” This project topic supports the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">United Nations Sustainability Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</a>. To reach this goal you will drive along the DMAIC, accompanied by a Master Black Belt as co-pilot. The route is determined by our navigation software (sigma guide). We will stop at every important sigma tool, which you will then apply in practice and document in a project storybook. This storybook will demonstrate the operational excellence of and in your work. (Please note: The implementation of company-specific, individually supported business projects for certification are not included in this edX/TUM course)</p>
<p>We will guide you through your improvement project. Each DMAIC phase concludes with a project review by a Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt. With the feedback on your achieved project results, we keep you on track before you start the next DMAIC phase. You will also participate in weekly live sessions online, where we will discuss the tools and logic of Six Sigma in-depth and answer any questions. The e-book for the course, <a href=""https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-31915-1"">Six Sigma Green Belt Certification Project</a>, is included in the course price.</p>

Worldviews - From Sustainability to Regeneration,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/1e10e841-4d5e-4765-8bc2-263ce09c3c28-ce1500bbd597.jpeg,https://www.edx.org/learn/ethics/eth-zurich-worldviews-from-sustainability-to-regeneration,"<p dir=""ltr"">This MOOC is the first part of an interconnected series of four MOOCs on Designing Resilient Regenerative Systems (DRRS) which bring together science, design and transformative praxis as a fluid, intervention-based and synergistic process for addressing complex challenges. This is explored through extending our worldviews, reframing complexity, designing as nature, activating our minds through physical movement, and connecting with new communities of practice. Successful completion of MOOC#1 is your gateway to enter the ETH Zurich DRRS executive degree program, with the first Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS).</p>","<p dir=""ltr"">This MOOC series is about creating positive impact in complex systems. It is about navigating complexity and uncertainty with new tools and practices, such as “organic emergence”: Complex systems are inherently dynamic and unpredictable: their properties are emergent. An organic way to engage with emergence is to trust in having the right tools and techniques to adaptively cope with sudden surprises or challenges, and to reveal hidden opportunities. In this first MOOC “Regenerative Systems: Sustainability to Regeneration” you train your consciousness about dominant and alternative worldviews. You learn the roots of sustainability and pathways to regeneration. You acquire tools to reframe complexity and befriend uncertainty. You learn to reconnect with nature and to design as nature. You gain awareness through practices of physical and mental activation via self-compassion techniques and flow experiences in nature.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Exciting real-world illustrations take you to Hemsedal Norway, Annecy France, Ostana Italy, and Mallorca Spain. This offers a comparative understanding of communities and regions undergoing sustainability transitions across different contexts, cultures, climates and geographies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

The prominent content you will learn in this first MOOC are an update on the current state of sustainability science, different angles to understand regeneration, methods such as systemic design and systems-oriented design, resilience assessment, circularity mapping, visual dialogue, cross-scale design, “view from above” perspectives, biomimicry, transdisciplinary research, real-world elaboration, metadesign, and more.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

The MOOCs’ didactics are designed to combine time and place independent virtual learning through pre-recorded conversations, both accessible as movies and audio files, readings, and practical engagement in nature. Virtual content stimulates physical and social interaction in the bio-region of the participants. An accompanying visual mapping process called Gigamapping acts as a designerly way to co-create your own learning journey and connect across the MOOC series to your final transformative design project. Your personal QUEST guides you through your learning journey. Our DRRS virtual network allows you to exchange with other MOOC participants and to find learning partners in your region where you live.</p>","<p dir=""ltr"">Climate change, biodiversity loss and pan-syndemics are some of today’s most pressing complex challenges. Much of our economies and societies are exhaustive, vulnerable, and unfair. We need to actively restore and regenerate ecosystems and their services while transforming our economies to become more circular and just. We require new knowledge systems and cultures leading to transformative action as the human impact on earth needs to be fundamentally redesigned.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Scientific knowledge and reasoning are the fundamental tools to guide policy and management decisions, especially in times of crises. But the limitations of reductionist science are evident due to the lack of widespread action in addressing today's highly complex challenges, which are self-emergent, unpredictable, span across nested scales, depend on societal behavioral transitions, and lack data.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Design disciplines offer creative ways of prototyping solutions in an iterative way. Design responds to a current problem by proposing future pathways, through a feedback exchange from praxis. Designerly praxis can benefit from science, for example by directing interventions and leveraging relationships based on quantitative data. Neither the analytical and descriptive tools of science, nor the iterative process of design alone are adequate for addressing complex challenges. Combining both cultures and methods of reasoning as a fluid, intervention-based and synergistic process is beneficial for fostering the regenerative, transformative action that is urgently required.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

Therefore, this MOOC series entitled “Designing Resilient Regenerative Systems” (DRRS) offers four consecutive MOOCs that aim to address these urgent and complex challenges. Participants are invited on a learning journey that includes emphasis on extending our worldviews, concepts like regeneration and resilience, befriending complexity and uncertainty, methods and hybrid practices of science and design, meta-design and the seeing of patterns and root causes, connecting more with our inner self, and becoming bio-regional weavers within communities of transformational learning and praxis.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">

This first MOOC places global crises in context with local and regional examples for planetary health. Participants build consciousness by questioning the dominant reductionist worldviews that drive our global societies and learn ways of rethinking our relationship with nature as a holistic approach of “interbeing,” which places humans as part of the broader web of life.</p>",3.2,20

<p>The course aims at analyzing the <strong>evolution of migration law</strong> and its main concepts, with numerous examples. In principle, each State is sovereign to give access to its territory, to grant a right of residence, to confer nationality or to remove migrants. However, this sovereignty is <strong>limited</strong> by, on the one hand, the <strong>respect of human rights</strong> and on the other, the <strong>integration of States in free movement schemes</strong> , such as the European Union.</p>
<p>The analysis is completed by a <strong>concrete approach of the procedures</strong> and a <strong>theoretical questioning on the future</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether you are a decision-maker, a judge, a lawyer, a human rights defender, a worker in a NGO or an IGO, you have to answer the complex questions related to migration. It requires precise theoretical and practical knowledge of national, regional and international law.

</ul>","<p>Electric powertrains are estimated to propel a large part of road vehicles in the future, due to their high efficiency and zero tailpipe emissions. But, the cost and weight of batteries and the time to charge them are arguments for the conventional powertrain in many vehicles. This makes it important for engineers working with vehicles to understand how both these powertrains work, and how to determine their performance and energy consumption for different type of vehicles and different ways of driving vehicles. </p>
<p>This course is aimed at learners with a bachelor's degree or engineers in the automotive industry who need to develop their knowledge about electric powertrains. </p>
<p>In this course, you will learn how electric and conventional combustion engine powertrains are built and how they work. You will learn methods to calculate their performance and energy consumption and how to simulate them in different driving cycles.

La visualización de datos es una forma rápida y fácil de transmitir conceptos de manera universal, y es posible el poder experimentar con diferentes escenarios haciendo pequeños ajustes.</p>
<p>La visualización de datos es la presentación de datos en un formato gráfico.</p>
<p>Permite a los tomadores de decisiones ver el análisis presentados visualmente, para que puedan comprender conceptos dificiles o identificar nuevos patrones.

<p>Cela dit, le management contemporain reste encore à inventer. Pour y parvenir, le gestionnaire d’aujourd’hui peut puiser dans l’histoire des théories du management. Il y trouvera toute une variété de solutions pratiques et de regards interprétatifs. Mais parce qu’il n’existe pas une telle chose qu’une théorie parfaite, le gestionnaire ne dispose que de solutions partielles et incomplètes. </p>
<p>Surtout, sa pratique concrète doit nécessairement osciller entre deux pôles complémentaires. D’un côté, il doit faire preuve d’efficacité et pour y parvenir, il dispose d’un grand nombre de techniques administratives et de règles de gestion qui le conduisent alors à penser l’organisation en termes juridiques, stratégiques, structurels et opérationnels. De l’autre, il ne peut pas se contenter d’être un technicien qui ne viserait que l’efficacité formelle; il doit aussi être profondément humain et inscrire son action dans le tissu social d’une organisation et du coup entrevoir ses dimensions politiques, symboliques, psychologiques et cognitives. </p>
<p>Ce cours de management s’adresse à celles et ceux qui sont à la recherche d’une meilleure compréhension des théories et des pratiques du management.

<li>celui du management charismatique qui s’appuie sur le charisme et se donne comme idéal la création;</li>
<li>et celui du management traditionnel qui s’appuie sur la tradition et se donne comme idéal l’harmonie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Les adeptes du management au sens technique se limitent au premier; les adeptes du leadership ne jurent que par le deuxième et, malgré la fascination que la nouveauté exerce dans l’univers de la gestion, la tradition persiste dans bien des organisations. Pourtant, le gestionnaire est toujours, d’une certaine manière, confronté à ces trois logiques.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many of the largest companies in the world with the highest capitalization were Japanese. Often, the key to Japan's success was attributed to its unique business model, strategies and practices. </p>
<p>However, Japan no longer enjoys strong growth. Since the infamous “burst of the bubble”, Japanese companies have slipped from dominance and lost their competitive edge to companies in America, China and other regions. Japan's once highly acclaimed business management has been critiqued, judged, and brought into question. </p>

<li>Business strategies that support these systems</li>
<li>Opportunities of designing with renewable, bio-based materials</li>
<li>Best practices through case studies with industry frontrunners</li>
</ul>","<p>It has become almost impossible to imagine what our lives would be like without the many benefits of packaging - just think about the different packaging and single-use items you use on a daily basis. Yet as our global population grows in size and affluence, both our collective demand for packaging materials and the waste we generate as a result will increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Currently, large amounts of packaging waste escape formal collection and recycling systems and eventually end up polluting the environment. Moreover, their material value is forever lost to the economy. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that uncollected plastic packaging waste alone is worth somewhere between 80 to 120 billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>So how can we improve packaging systems in order to capture this wasted potential? Clearly, the way we currently design, recover, and reuse packaging urgently needs a rethink!</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the design of sustainable packaging systems. To do so we will explore the design and business strategies of the circular economy.</p>
<p>Contrary to our current industrial model, which extracts, uses and ultimately disposes of resources, a circular economy is regenerative by design. This means that products and services are reimagined from a systems perspective in order to minimize waste, maximize positive economic, environmental and social impacts, and keep resources locked in a cycle of restoration.</p>
<p>This course is for you if you are interested in learning about sustainable packaging design. You'll also benefit if you are a professional in the packaging industry and want to learn how to find circular opportunities in your work. Students - particularly in design -will be able to broaden their knowledge of circular design and business strategies.</p>",2.9,7

</ol>","<p>Modern IT infrastructure is built as distributed systems, an exciting concept that started with the first computers and evolved rapidly into its present form. From online video meetings to internet services, from social media platforms to online games, we all use and interact with distributed systems on a daily basis and increasingly depend on them. Designing and operating such large-scale distributed systems, however, is complex and typically involves making reasonable compromises. There are fundamental technical barriers as well as economic arguments why we cannot make these systems behave as if they were running on a single, perfectly reliable machine.. </p>
<p>In this course, learners will be introduced to the essential functional and non-functional concerns of distributed systems and the common problems encountered while designing them, such as consistency, availability, elasticity, and scalability. A variety of practical solutions that have been established in the leading tech industry in recent years will be reviewed. These provide re-usable building blocks to create new large-scale applications. These recent developments, especially around cloud computing, large-scale data processing, distributed machine learning, and other fields are often not reflected in textbooks and are absent from many traditional curricula but are at the heart of this course. </p>
<p>The course will therefore provide learners with the fundamental understanding (theoretical and practical foundations) of how cloud, edge, and big data processing systems work and how they address common challenges for distributed systems such as performance, resilience, and scalability.</p>
<p>The learning progress is assessed through a variety of different activities including quizzes, design exercises, experiments, and open questions, with peer review of other students’ solutions. In the final project, learners will design a distributed system based on the learners’ own experience and interests and describe the functional and non-functional properties of the system.</p>",3.6,15

<p>Have you been curious about the ways they invade our bodies, attack our cells and make us sick? Come and learn what viruses are made of and understand the mechanisms of how they hijack and take over our cells.</p>
<p>Our bodies are made of cells, which are amazing molecular machines. So long as everything is in working order, we feel great. But surprisingly, these unbelievably tiny parasites, made of protein and genes - viruses - can take control, causing serious damage to our bodies.</p>
<p>Step by step, this course - the first part of the Viruses &amp; How to Beat Them program - will teach you how the cells of our bodies work to keep us healthy. We will then explore the vast kingdom of viruses; especially those that have caused epidemics like the flu, AIDS and Ebola. In the second part of the program, we will learn how our body defends itself against these viruses, with special attention to the latest threat: SARS CoV2 and the disease it causes - COVID-19.</p>
<p>The lectures have been carefully planned to clearly describe basic Cell Biology and Virology in terms that everyone can understand, without compromising scientific correctness.

<p>Theatrical scenography is made of several complex phases aiming at recreating an intended illusory effect sketched first by the scenographer. The sketch is made in perspective and it consists in a painting containing all the instructions needed for its exact implementation on the stage. In fact, the planning, control and reproduction of a specific desidered illusion in a scene has been granted for centuries now, by perspective. This MOOC will present some of the essential geometric principles on the accelerated solid perspective, i.e. an illusory method used for the construction of a physical space tricking the audience with greater depths than there actually are on the stage. Moreover, the students will master the geometry behind the scenic reproduction of the sketch: from the two-dimensional painting to the three-dimensional space of the stage, by going on a short journey through the historical phases of scenography from the XVIth century to today and through the acquisition of fundamental concepts of this discipline. </p>
<p>This course will finally show how the conscious use of the perspective processes applied to the theatrical scene has led to the stage implementation of three graduation thesis proposals in three famous operas: Aida, Tosca and Madam Butterfly.</p>",2.7,8
